 ## What's new
 
+### CVE-2023-28836: Stored XSS attack via ModelAdmin views
+
+This release addresses a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability on ModelAdmin views within the Wagtail admin interface. A user with a limited-permission editor account for the Wagtail admin could potentially craft pages and documents that, when viewed by a user with higher privileges, could perform actions with that user's credentials. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin, and only affects sites with ModelAdmin enabled.
+
+Many thanks to Thibaud Colas for reporting this issue. For further details, please see [the CVE-2023-28836 security advisory](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/security/advisories/GHSA-5286-f2rf-35c2).
