#################### LLM PATCH ANALYSIS PACKAGE ####################

You are a security patch migration expert.

Your task:
1. Look at the OLD code (vulnerable).
2. Look at the NEW code (patched).
3. Look at the DIFF.
4. Decide whether the patch can be applied to the old version:
   - Yes      → applies cleanly
   - Maybe    → applies with adjustments
   - No       → cannot be applied
5. Provide a short explanation.

IMPORTANT:
Return ONLY JSON of this form:

{
  "portability": "Yes/Maybe/No",
  "reason": "<short explanation>"
}

     As a security measure, the `message` passed to any of these methods will be passed through the `nautobot.utilities.logging.sanitize()` function in an attempt to strip out information such as usernames/passwords that should not be saved to the logs. This is of course best-effort only, and Job authors should take pains to ensure that such information is not passed to the logging APIs in the first place. The set of redaction rules used by the `sanitize()` function can be configured as [settings.SANITIZER_PATTERNS](../configuration/optional-settings.md#sanitizer_patterns).

# Optional Configuration Settings

## Administratively Configurable Settings

+++ 1.2.0

A number of settings can alternatively be configured via the Nautobot Admin UI. To do so, these settings must **not** be defined in your `nautobot_config.py`, as any settings defined there will take precedence over any values defined in the Admin UI. Settings that are currently configurable via the Admin UI include:

* [BANNER_BOTTOM](#banner_bottom)
* [BANNER_LOGIN](#banner_login)
* [BANNER_TOP](#banner_top)
* [CHANGELOG_RETENTION](#changelog_retention)
* [DEPLOYMENT_ID](#deployment_id)
* [DYNAMIC_GROUPS_MEMBER_CACHE_TIMEOUT](#dynamic_groups_member_cache_timeout)
* [HIDE_RESTRICTED_UI](#hide_restricted_ui)
* [MAX_PAGE_SIZE](#max_page_size)
* [NETWORK_DRIVERS](#network_drivers)
* [PAGINATE_COUNT](#paginate_count)
* [PER_PAGE_DEFAULTS](#per_page_defaults)
* [PREFER_IPV4](#prefer_ipv4)
* [RACK_ELEVATION_DEFAULT_UNIT_HEIGHT](#rack_elevation_default_unit_height)
* [RACK_ELEVATION_DEFAULT_UNIT_WIDTH](#rack_elevation_default_unit_width)
* [RELEASE_CHECK_TIMEOUT](#release_check_timeout)
* [RELEASE_CHECK_URL](#release_check_url)
* [SUPPORT_MESSAGE](#support_message)

## Extra Applications

A need may arise to allow the user to register additional settings. These will automatically apply
based on keynames prefixed with `EXTRA_` assuming the base key (the latter part of the setting name) is
of type list or tuple.

For example, to register additional `INSTALLED_APPS`, you would simply specify this in your custom
(user) configuration::

```python
EXTRA_INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'foo.bar',
]
```

This will ensure your default setting's `INSTALLED_APPS` do not have to be modified, and the user
can specify additional apps with ease.  Similarly, additional `MIDDLEWARE` can be added using `EXTRA_MIDDLEWARE`.

## ALLOWED_URL_SCHEMES

Default: `('file', 'ftp', 'ftps', 'http', 'https', 'irc', 'mailto', 'sftp', 'ssh', 'tel', 'telnet', 'tftp', 'vnc', 'xmpp')`

A list of permitted URL schemes referenced when rendering links within Nautobot. Note that only the schemes specified in this list will be accepted: If adding your own, be sure to replicate all of the default values as well (excluding those schemes which are not desirable).

---

## BANNER_TOP

## BANNER_BOTTOM

Default: `""` (Empty string)

Setting these variables will display custom content in a banner at the top and/or bottom of the page, respectively. HTML is allowed. To replicate the content of the top banner in the bottom banner, set:

```python
BANNER_TOP = 'Your banner text'
BANNER_BOTTOM = BANNER_TOP
```

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for these settings in your `nautobot_config.py`, they can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for either setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## BANNER_LOGIN

Default: `""` (Empty string)

This defines custom content to be displayed on the login page above the login form. HTML is allowed.

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## BRANDING_FILEPATHS

Default:

```python
{
    "logo": os.getenv("NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_LOGO", None),  # Navbar logo
    "favicon": os.getenv("NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_FAVICON", None),  # Browser favicon
    "icon_16": os.getenv("NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_ICON_16", None),  # 16x16px icon
    "icon_32": os.getenv("NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_ICON_32", None),  # 32x32px icon
    "icon_180": os.getenv("NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_ICON_180", None),  # 180x180px icon - used for the apple-touch-icon header
    "icon_192": os.getenv("NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_ICON_192", None),  # 192x192px icon
    "icon_mask": os.getenv("NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_ICON_MASK", None),  # mono-chrome icon used for the mask-icon header
}
```

A set of filepaths relative to the [`MEDIA_ROOT`](#media_root) which locate image assets used for custom branding. Each of these assets takes the place of the corresponding stock Nautobot asset. This allows for instance, providing your own navbar logo and favicon.

These environment variables may be used to specify the values:

* `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_LOGO`
* `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_FAVICON`
* `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_ICON_16`
* `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_ICON_32`
* `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_ICON_180`
* `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_ICON_192`
* `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_ICON_MASK`

If a custom image asset is not provided for any of the above options, the stock Nautobot asset is used.

---

## BRANDING_PREPENDED_FILENAME

+++ 1.3.4

Default: `"nautobot_"`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_PREPENDED_FILENAME`

Defines the prefix of the filename when exporting to CSV/YAML or export templates.

---

## BRANDING_TITLE

Default: `"Nautobot"`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_TITLE`

The defines the custom branding title that should be used in place of "Nautobot" within user facing areas of the application like the HTML title of web pages.

---

## BRANDING_URLS

Default:

```python
{
    "code": os.getenv("NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_URLS_CODE", "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot"),  # Code link in the footer
    "docs": os.getenv("NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_URLS_DOCS", "<STATIC_URL>docs/index.html"),  # Docs link in the footer
    "help": os.getenv("NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_URLS_HELP", "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/wiki"),  # Help link in the footer
}
```

A set of URLs that correspond to helpful links in the right of the footer on every web page.

These environment variables may be used to specify the values:

* `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_URLS_CODE`
* `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_URLS_DOCS`
* `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_URLS_HELP`

If a custom URL is not provided for any of the links, the default link within the Nautobot community is used.

---

## CACHEOPS_DEFAULTS

Default: `{'timeout': 900}` (15 minutes, in seconds)

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_CACHEOPS_TIMEOUT` (timeout value only)

!!! warning
    It is an error to set the timeout value to `0`. If you wish to disable caching, please use [`CACHEOPS_ENABLED`](#cacheops_enabled).

Various defaults for caching, the most important of which being the cache timeout. The `timeout` is the number of seconds that cache entries will be retained before expiring.

---

## CACHEOPS_ENABLED

Default: `False`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_CACHEOPS_ENABLED`

A boolean that turns on/off caching.

!!! check "Changed in 1.5.0"
    Cachopes is disabled by default and will be removed entirely in a future release.

If set to `False`, all caching is bypassed and Nautobot operates as if there is no cache.

---

## CACHEOPS_HEALTH_CHECK_ENABLED

Default: `False`

A boolean that turns on/off health checks for the Redis server connection utilized by Cacheops. Most deployments share a Redis server with `django-redis` as such we only need to check the health of Redis one time.  If you are using a separate Redis deployment for Cacheops, please consider enabling this to monitor that Redis deployment.  Keep in mind the more health checks enabled the longer the health checks will take and timeouts might need to be increased.

---

## CELERY_BROKER_TRANSPORT_OPTIONS

Default: `{}`

A dict of additional options passed to the Celery broker transport. This is only required when [configuring Celery to utilize Redis Sentinel](../additional-features/caching.md#celery-sentinel-configuration).

---

## CELERY_BROKER_URL

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_CELERY_BROKER_URL`

Default: `'redis://localhost:6379/0'`

Celery broker URL used to tell workers where queues are located.

---

## CELERY_TASK_DEFAULT_QUEUE

+++ 1.5.0

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_CELERY_TASK_DEFAULT_QUEUE`

Default: `'default'`

The default celery queue name that will be used by workers if no queue is specified in the `nautobot-server celery worker` command. This queue will also be used by celery tasks if no queue is specified when a task is run.

---

## CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND`

Default: `'redis://localhost:6379/0'`

Celery result backend used to tell workers where to store task results (tombstones).

---

## CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND_TRANSPORT_OPTIONS

Default: `{}`

A dict of additional options passed to the Celery result backend transport. This is only required when [configuring Celery to utilize Redis Sentinel](../additional-features/caching.md#celery-sentinel-configuration).

---

## CELERY_TASK_SOFT_TIME_LIMIT

Default: `300` (5 minutes)

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_CELERY_TASK_SOFT_TIME_LIMIT`

The global Celery task soft timeout (in seconds). Any background task that exceeds this duration will receive a `SoftTimeLimitExceeded` exception and is responsible for handling this exception and performing any necessary cleanup or final operations before ending. See also `CELERY_TASK_TIME_LIMIT` below.

---

## CELERY_TASK_TIME_LIMIT

Default: `600` (10 minutes)

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_CELERY_TASK_TIME_LIMIT`

The global Celery task hard timeout (in seconds). Any background task that exceeds this duration will be forcibly killed with a `SIGKILL` signal.

---

## CELERY_WORKER_PROMETHEUS_PORTS

+++ 1.5.10

Default: `[]` (disabled)

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_CELERY_WORKER_PROMETHEUS_PORTS`

Ports for Prometheus metric HTTP server running on the celery worker(s).

Normally this should be set to a single port, unless you have multiple workers running on a single machine, i.e.
sharing the same available ports. In that case you need to specify a range of ports greater than or equal to the
highest amount of workers you are running on a single machine (comma-separated, like "8080,8081,8082"). You can then use
the `target_limit` parameter to the Prometheus `scrape_config` to ensure you are not getting duplicate metrics in that
case. Set this to an empty list to disable it.

---

## CHANGELOG_RETENTION

Default: `90`

The number of days to retain logged changes (object creations, updates, and deletions). Set this to `0` to retain changes in the database indefinitely.

!!! warning
    If enabling indefinite changelog retention, it is recommended to periodically delete old entries. Otherwise, the database may eventually exceed capacity.

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## CONFIG_CONTEXT_DYNAMIC_GROUPS_ENALBED

Default: `False`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_CONFIG_CONTEXT_DYNAMIC_GROUPS_ENABLED`

If `True`, it will be possible to apply Config Context objects to Devices and Virtual Machines via Dynamic Group membership. When set to `False` this behavior will not be available.

!!! warning
    With a large number of dynamic groups, enabling this could invoke a performance penalty when processing Config Contexts.

---

## CONTENT_TYPE_CACHE_TIMEOUT

+++ 1.6.0

Default: `0` (disabled)

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_CONTENT_TYPE_CACHE_TIMEOUT`

The number of seconds to cache the content type accessible via a object's class property `Object._content_type_cached`. This can save frequent calls to `ContentType.objects.get_for_model(model)`. Set this to `0` to disable caching.

---

## CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS

Default: `False`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS`

If `True`, all origins will be allowed. Other settings restricting allowed origins will be ignored.

Setting this to `True` can be dangerous, as it allows any website to make cross-origin requests to yours. Generally you'll want to restrict the list of allowed origins with [`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`](#cors_allowed_origins) or [`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEXES`](#cors_allowed_origin_regexes).

Previously this setting was called `CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL`, which still works as an alias, with the new name taking precedence.

---

## CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS

Default: `[]` (Empty list)

A list of origins that are authorized to make cross-site HTTP requests.

An Origin is defined by [the CORS RFC Section 3.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454#section-3.2) as a URI `scheme + hostname + port`, or one of the special values `'null'` or `'file://'`. Default ports (HTTPS = 443, HTTP = 80) are optional here.

The special value `null` is sent by the browser in ["privacy-sensitive contexts"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454#section-6), such as when the client is running from a `file://` domain. The special value `file://` is sent accidentally by some versions of Chrome on Android as per this bug.

Example:

```python
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
    "https://example.com",
    "https://sub.example.com",
    "http://localhost:8080",
    "http://127.0.0.1:9000"
]
```

Previously this setting was called `CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST`, which still works as an alias, with the new name taking precedence.

---

## CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEXES

Default: `[]`

A list of strings representing regexes that match Origins that are authorized to make cross-site HTTP requests. Useful when [`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`](#cors_allowed_origins) is impractical, such as when you have a large number of subdomains.

Example:

```python
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEXES = [
    r"^https://\w+\.example\.com$",
]
```

Previously this setting was called `CORS_ORIGIN_REGEX_WHITELIST`, which still works as an alias, with the new name taking precedence.

---

## DEPLOYMENT_ID

+++ 1.6.0

Default: a random UUID generated at install time.

This setting is used to uniquely but anonymously identify Nautobot deployments when sending installation metrics. This setting is not generally intended to be user-serviceable. See the documentation for the [`send_installation_metrics`](../administration/nautobot-server.md#send_installation_metrics) management command for more details.

## DISABLE_PREFIX_LIST_HIERARCHY

Default: `False`

This setting disables rendering of the IP prefix hierarchy (parent/child relationships) in the IPAM prefix list view. With large sets of prefixes, users may encounter a performance penalty when trying to load the prefix list view due to the nature of calculating the parent/child relationships. This setting allows users to disable the hierarchy and instead only render a flat list of all prefixes in the table.

A later release of Nautobot will address the underlying performance issues, and likely remove this configuration option.

---

## DYNAMIC_GROUPS_MEMBER_CACHE_TIMEOUT

+++ 1.6.0

Default: `0` (disabled)

The number of seconds to cache the member list of dynamic groups. With large datasets (those in scope of a Dynamic Group and number of Dynamic Groups themselves), users will encounter a performance penalty using or accessing the membership lists. This setting allows users to accept a cached list for common use cases (particularly in the UI) that expires after the configured time. Set this to `0` to disable caching.

---

## ENFORCE_GLOBAL_UNIQUE

Default: `False`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_ENFORCE_GLOBAL_UNIQUE`

By default, Nautobot will permit users to create duplicate prefixes and IP addresses in the global table (that is, those which are not assigned to any VRF). This behavior can be disabled by setting `ENFORCE_GLOBAL_UNIQUE` to `True`.

---

## EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS

Default: `[]` (Empty list)

A list of Nautobot models to exempt from the enforcement of view permissions. Models listed here will be viewable by all users, both authenticated and anonymous.

List models in the form `<app>.<model>`. For example:

```python
EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS = [
    'dcim.site',
    'dcim.region',
    'ipam.prefix',
]
```

To exempt _all_ models from view permission enforcement, set the following. (Note that `EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS` must be an iterable.)

```python
EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS = ['*']
```

!!! note
    Using a wildcard will not affect certain potentially sensitive models, such as user permissions. If there is a need to exempt these models, they must be specified individually.

---

## EXTERNAL_AUTH_DEFAULT_GROUPS

Default: `[]` (Empty list)

The list of group names to assign a new user account when created using 3rd-party authentication.

---

## EXTERNAL_AUTH_DEFAULT_PERMISSIONS

Default: `{}` (Empty dictionary)

A mapping of permissions to assign a new user account when created using SSO authentication. Each key in the dictionary will be the permission name specified as `<app_label>.<action>_<model>`, and the value should be set to the permission [constraints](../administration/permissions.md#constraints), or `None` to allow all objects.

### Example Permissions

| Permission | Description |
|---|---|
| `{'dcim.view_device': {}}` or `{'dcim.view_device': None}` | Users can view all devices |
| `{'dcim.add_device': {}}` | Users can add devices, see note below |
| `{'dcim.view_device': {"site__name__in":  ["HQ"]}}` | Users can view all devices in the HQ site |

!!! warning
    Permissions can be complicated! Be careful when restricting permissions to also add any required prerequisite permissions.

    For example, when adding Devices the Device Role, Device Type, Site, and Status fields are all required fields in order for the UI to function properly. Users will also need view permissions for those fields or the corresponding field selections in the UI will be unavailable and potentially prevent objects from being able to be created or edited.

The following example gives a user a reasonable amount of access to add devices to a single site (HQ in this case):

```python
{
    'dcim.add_device': {"site__name__in":  ["HQ"]},
    'dcim.view_device': {"site__name__in":  ["HQ"]},
    'dcim.view_devicerole': None,
    'dcim.view_devicetype': None,
    'extras.view_status': None,
    'dcim.view_site': {"name__in":  ["HQ"]},
    'dcim.view_manufacturer': None,
    'dcim.view_region': None,
    'dcim.view_rack': None,
    'dcim.view_rackgroup': None,
    'dcim.view_platform': None,
    'virtualization.view_cluster': None,
    'virtualization.view_clustergroup': None,
    'tenancy.view_tenant': None,
    'tenancy.view_tenantgroup': None,
}
```

Please see [the object permissions page](../administration/permissions.md) for more information.

---

## GIT_ROOT

Default: `os.path.join(NAUTOBOT_ROOT, "git")`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_GIT_ROOT`

The file path to a directory where cloned [Git repositories](../models/extras/gitrepository.md) will be located.

The value of this variable can also be customized by setting the environment variable `NAUTOBOT_GIT_ROOT` to a directory path of your choosing.

---

## GRAPHQL_COMPUTED_FIELD_PREFIX

Default: `"cpf"`

By default, all computed fields in GraphQL will be prefixed with `cf`. A computed field named `my_field` will appear in GraphQL as `cpf_my_field` by default. It's possible to change or remove the prefix by setting the value of `GRAPHQL_COMPUTED_FIELD_PREFIX`.

---

## GRAPHQL_CUSTOM_FIELD_PREFIX

Default: `"cf"`

By default, all custom fields in GraphQL will be prefixed with `cf`. A custom field named `my_field` will appear in GraphQL as `cf_my_field` by default. It's possible to change or remove the prefix by setting the value of `GRAPHQL_CUSTOM_FIELD_PREFIX`.

---

## GRAPHQL_RELATIONSHIP_PREFIX

Default: `"rel"`

By default, all relationship associations in GraphQL will be prefixed with `rel`. A relationship named `my_relationship` will appear in GraphQL as `rel_my_relationship` by default. It's possible to change or remove the prefix by setting the value of `GRAPHQL_RELATIONSHIP_PREFIX`.

---

## HIDE_RESTRICTED_UI

Default: `False`

When set to `True`, users with limited permissions will only be able to see items in the UI they have access to.

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

+++ 1.3.10
    When this setting is set to `True`, logged out users will be redirected to the login page when navigating to the Nautobot home page.

---

## HTTP_PROXIES

Default: `None` (Disabled)

A dictionary of HTTP proxies to use for outbound requests originating from Nautobot (e.g. when sending webhook requests). Proxies should be specified by schema (HTTP and HTTPS) as per the [Python requests library documentation](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/). For example:

```python
HTTP_PROXIES = {
    'http': 'http://10.10.1.10:3128',
    'https': 'http://10.10.1.10:1080',
}
```

!!! note
    When using Git repositories within Nautobot the Python library `GitPython` needs extra proxy configuration:

```bash
git config --global http.proxy http://192.0.2.1:3128
git config --global https.proxy http://192.0.2.1:3128
```

---

## INSTALLATION_METRICS_ENABLED

+++ 1.6.0

Default: `True` for existing Nautobot deployments, user-specified when running `nautobot-server init` for a new deployment.

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_INSTALLATION_METRICS_ENABLED`

When set to `True`, Nautobot will send anonymized installation metrics to the Nautobot maintainers when running the [`post_upgrade`](../administration/nautobot-server.md#post_upgrade) or [`send_installation_metrics`](../administration/nautobot-server.md#send_installation_metrics) management commands. See the documentation for the [`send_installation_metrics`](../administration/nautobot-server.md#send_installation_metrics) management command for more details.

## JOBS_ROOT

Default: `os.path.join(NAUTOBOT_ROOT, "jobs")`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_JOBS_ROOT`

The file path to a directory where [Jobs](../additional-features/jobs.md) can be discovered.

!!! caution
    This directory **must** contain an `__init__.py` file.

---

## LOG_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS

--- 1.5.3
    This setting was moved to [environment variable only](#nautobot_log_deprecation_warnings) as it conflicts with app startup due to import-time order.

---

## MAINTENANCE_MODE

Default: `False`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_MAINTENANCE_MODE`

Setting this to `True` will display a "maintenance mode" banner at the top of every page. Additionally, Nautobot will no longer update a user's "last active" time upon login. This is to allow new logins when the database is in a read-only state. Recording of login times will resume when maintenance mode is disabled.

!!! note
    The default [`SESSION_ENGINE`](#session_engine) configuration will store sessions in the database, this obviously will not work when `MAINTENANCE_MODE` is `True` and the database is in a read-only state for maintenance.  Consider setting `SESSION_ENGINE` to `django.contrib.sessions.backends.cache` when enabling `MAINTENANCE_MODE`.

!!! note
    The Docker container normally attempts to run migrations on startup; however, if the database is in a read-only state the Docker container will fail to start.  Setting the environment variable [`NAUTOBOT_DOCKER_SKIP_INIT`](../docker/index.md#nautobot_docker_skip_init) to `true` will prevent the migrations from occurring.

!!! note
    If you are using `django-auth-ldap` for LDAP authentication, `django-auth-ldap` by default will try to update a user object on every log in.  If the database is in a read-only state `django-auth-ldap` will fail.  You will also need to set `AUTH_LDAP_ALWAYS_UPDATE_USER=False` and `AUTH_LDAP_NO_NEW_USERS=True` to avoid this, please see the [`django-auth-ldap` documentation](https://django-auth-ldap.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference.html) for more information.

---

## MAX_PAGE_SIZE

Default: `1000`

A web user or API consumer can request an arbitrary number of objects by appending the "limit" parameter to the URL (e.g. `?limit=1000`). This parameter defines the maximum acceptable limit. Setting this to `0` or `None` will allow a client to retrieve _all_ matching objects at once with no limit by specifying `?limit=0`.

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## METRICS_ENABLED

Default: `False`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_METRICS_ENABLED`

Toggle the availability Prometheus-compatible metrics at `/metrics`. See the [Prometheus Metrics](../additional-features/prometheus-metrics.md) documentation for more details.

---

## NAPALM_USERNAME

## NAPALM_PASSWORD

Default: `""` (Empty string)

Environment Variables: `NAUTOBOT_NAPALM_USERNAME` and `NAUTOBOT_NAPALM_PASSWORD`

Nautobot will use these credentials when authenticating to remote devices via the [NAPALM library](https://napalm.readthedocs.io), if installed. Both parameters are optional.

!!! note
    If SSH public key authentication has been set up on the remote device(s) for the system account under which Nautobot runs, these parameters are not needed.

!!! note
    If a given device has an appropriately populated [secrets group](../models/extras/secretsgroup.md) assigned to it, the [secrets](../models/extras/secret.md) defined in that group will take precedence over these default values.

---

## NAPALM_ARGS

Default: `{}` (Empty dictionary)

A dictionary of optional arguments to pass to NAPALM when instantiating a network driver. See the NAPALM documentation for a [complete list of optional arguments](https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/support/#optional-arguments). An example:

```python
NAPALM_ARGS = {
    'api_key': '472071a93b60a1bd1fafb401d9f8ef41',
    'port': 2222,
}
```

Some platforms (e.g. Cisco IOS) require an enable password to be passed in addition to the normal password. If desired, you can use the configured `NAPALM_PASSWORD` as the value for this argument:

```python
NAPALM_USERNAME = 'username'
NAPALM_PASSWORD = 'MySecretPassword'
NAPALM_ARGS = {
    'secret': NAPALM_PASSWORD,          # ios and nxos_ssh
    'enable_password': NAPALM_PASSWORD, # eos
    # Include any additional args here
}
```

!!! note
    If a given device has an appropriately populated [secrets group](../models/extras/secretsgroup.md) assigned to it, a [secret](../models/extras/secret.md) defined in that group can override the `NAPALM_ARGS["secret"]` or `NAPALM_ARGS["enable_password"]` default value defined here.

---

## NAPALM_TIMEOUT

Default: `30`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_NAPALM_TIMEOUT`

The amount of time (in seconds) to wait for NAPALM to connect to a device.

---

## NETWORK_DRIVERS

+++ 1.6.0

Default: `{}` (Empty dictionary)

An optional dictionary to extend or override the default `Platform.network_driver` translations provided by [netutils](https://netutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/lib_use_cases_lib_mapper/). For example, to add support for a custom `Platform.network_driver` value of `"my_network_driver"` for Netmiko and PyATS drivers:

```python
NETWORK_DRIVERS = {
    "netmiko": {"my_network_driver": "cisco_ios"},
    "pyats": {"my_network_driver": "iosxe"},
}
```

The default top-level keys are `ansible`, `hier_config`, `napalm`, `netmiko`, `ntc_templates`, `pyats`, `pyntc`, and `scrapli`, but you can also add additional keys if you have an alternative network driver that you want your Nautobot instance to include.

!!! tip
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## PAGINATE_COUNT

Default: `50`

The default maximum number of objects to display per page within each list of objects. Applies to both the UI and the REST API.

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## PER_PAGE_DEFAULTS

Default: `[25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000]`

The options displayed in the web interface dropdown to limit the number of objects per page. For proper user experience, this list should include the [`PAGINATE_COUNT`](#paginate_count) and [`MAX_PAGE_SIZE`](#max_page_size) values as options.

---

## PLUGINS

Default: `[]` (Empty list)

A list of installed [Nautobot plugins](../plugins/index.md) to enable. Plugins will not take effect unless they are listed here.

!!! warning
    Plugins extend Nautobot by allowing external code to run with the same access and privileges as Nautobot itself. Only install plugins from trusted sources. The Nautobot maintainers make absolutely no guarantees about the integrity or security of your installation with plugins enabled.

---

## PLUGINS_CONFIG

Default: `{}` (Empty dictionary)

This parameter holds configuration settings for individual Nautobot plugins. It is defined as a dictionary, with each key using the name of an installed plugin. The specific parameters supported are unique to each plugin: Reference the plugin's documentation to determine the supported parameters. An example configuration is shown below:

```python
PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    'plugin1': {
        'foo': 123,
        'bar': True
    },
    'plugin2': {
        'foo': 456,
    },
}
```

Note that a plugin must be listed in `PLUGINS` for its configuration to take effect.

---

## PREFER_IPV4

Default: `False`

When determining the primary IP address for a device, IPv6 is preferred over IPv4 by default. Set this to True to prefer IPv4 instead.

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## RACK_ELEVATION_DEFAULT_UNIT_HEIGHT

Default: `22`

Default height (in pixels) of a unit within a rack elevation. For best results, this should be approximately one tenth of `RACK_ELEVATION_DEFAULT_UNIT_WIDTH`.

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## RACK_ELEVATION_DEFAULT_UNIT_WIDTH

Default: `220`

Default width (in pixels) of a unit within a rack elevation.

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## REDIS_LOCK_TIMEOUT

Default: `600`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_REDIS_LOCK_TIMEOUT`

Maximum duration of a Redis lock created when calling `/api/ipam/prefixes/{id}/available-prefixes/` or `/api/ipam/prefixes/{id}/available-ips/` to avoid inadvertently allocating the same prefix or IP to multiple simultaneous callers. Default is set to 600 seconds (10 minutes) to be longer than any theoretical API call time. This is to prevent a deadlock scenario where the server did not gracefully exit the `with` block when acquiring the Redis lock.

---

## RELEASE_CHECK_TIMEOUT

Default: `86400` (24 hours)

The number of seconds to retain the latest version that is fetched from the GitHub API before automatically invalidating it and fetching it from the API again.

!!! warning
    This must be set to at least one hour (`3600` seconds). Setting it to a value lower than this is an error.

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## RELEASE_CHECK_URL

Default: `None` (disabled)

This parameter defines the URL of the repository that will be checked periodically for new Nautobot releases. When a new release is detected, a message will be displayed to administrative users on the home page. This can be set to the official repository (`'https://api.github.com/repos/nautobot/nautobot/releases'`) or a custom fork. Set this to `None` to disable automatic update checks.

!!! note
    The URL provided **must** be compatible with the [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest).

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## SANITIZER_PATTERNS

+++ 1.3.4

Default:

```python
[
    (re.compile(r"(https?://)?\S+\s*@", re.IGNORECASE), r"\1{replacement}@"),
    (re.compile(r"(username|password|passwd|pwd)((?:\s+is.?|:)?\s+)\S+", re.IGNORECASE), r"\1\2{replacement}"),
]
```

List of (regular expression, replacement pattern) tuples used by the `nautobot.utilities.logging.sanitize()` function. As of Nautobot 1.3.4 this function is used primarily for sanitization of Job log entries, but it may be used in other scopes in the future.

---

## STORAGE_BACKEND

Default: `None` (local storage)

The backend storage engine for handling uploaded files (e.g. image attachments). Nautobot supports integration with the [`django-storages`](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package, which provides backends for several popular file storage services. If not configured, local filesystem storage will be used.

An example of using django-storages with AWS S3 buckets, visit the [django-storages with S3](../user-guides/s3-django-storage.md) user-guide.

The configuration parameters for the specified storage backend are defined under the [`STORAGE_CONFIG`](#storage_config) setting.

---

## STORAGE_CONFIG

Default: `{}` (Empty dictionary)

A dictionary of configuration parameters for the storage backend configured as [`STORAGE_BACKEND`](#storage_backend). The specific parameters to be used here are specific to each backend; see the [`django-storages` documentation](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for more detail.

If [`STORAGE_BACKEND`](#storage_backend) is not defined, this setting will be ignored.

---

## STRICT_FILTERING

+++ 1.4.0

Default: `True`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_STRICT_FILTERING`

If set to `True` (default), UI and REST API filtering of object lists will fail if an unknown/unrecognized filter parameter is provided as a URL parameter. (For example, `/dcim/devices/?ice_cream_flavor=chocolate` or `/api/dcim/sites/?ice_cream_flavor=chocolate`). UI list (table) views will report an error message in this case and display no filtered objects; REST API list endpoints will return a 400 Bad Request response with an explanatory error message.

If set to `False`, unknown/unrecognized filter parameters will be discarded and ignored, although Nautobot will log a warning message.

!!! warning
    Setting this to `False` can result in unexpected filtering results in the case of user error, for example `/dcim/devices/?has_primry_ip=false` (note the typo `primry`) will result in a list of all devices, rather than the intended list of only devices that lack a primary IP address. In the case of Jobs or external automation making use of such a filter, this could have wide-ranging consequences.

---

## SUPPORT_MESSAGE

+++ 1.6.4

Default: `""`

A message to include on error pages (status code 403, 404, 500, etc.) when an error occurs. You can configure this to direct users to the appropriate contact(s) within your organization that provide support for Nautobot. Markdown formatting is supported within this message (raw HTML is not).

If unset, the default message that will appear is `If further assistance is required, please join the #nautobot channel on [Network to Code's Slack community](https://slack.networktocode.com) and post your question.`

!!! tip
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## TEST_FACTORY_SEED

+++ 1.5.0

Default: `None`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_TEST_FACTORY_SEED`

When [`TEST_USE_FACTORIES`](#test_use_factories) is set to `True`, this configuration provides a fixed seed string for the pseudo-random generator used to populate test data into the database, providing for reproducible randomness across consecutive test runs. If unset, a random seed will be used each time.

---

## TEST_USE_FACTORIES

+++ 1.5.0

Default: `False`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_TEST_USE_FACTORIES`

If set to `True`, the Nautobot test runner will call `nautobot-server generate_test_data ...` before executing any test cases, pre-populating the test database with various pseudo-random instances of many of Nautobot's data models.

!!! warning
    This functionality requires the installation of the [`factory-boy`](https://pypi.org/project/factory-boy/) Python package, which is present in Nautobot's own development environment, but is _not_ an inherent dependency of the Nautobot package when installed otherwise, such as into a plugin's development environment.

!!! info
    Setting this to `True` is a requirement for all Nautobot core tests as of 1.5.0, and it is set accordingly in `nautobot/core/tests/nautobot_config.py`, but defaults to `False` otherwise so as to remain backwards-compatible with plugins that also may use the Nautobot test runner in their own test environments, but have not yet updated their tests to account for the presence of this test data.

    Because this test data can obviate the need to manually construct complex test data, and the random factor can improve test robustness, plugin developers are encouraged to set this to `True` in their configuration, ensure that their development environments include the `factory-boy` Python package as a test dependency, and update their tests as needed.

---

## TEST_PERFORMANCE_BASELINE_FILE

+++ 1.5.0

Default: `nautobot/core/tests/performance_baselines.yml`

Environment Variable: `TEST_PERFORMANCE_BASELINE_FILE`

[`TEST_PERFORMANCE_BASELINE_FILE`](#test_performance_baseline_file) is set to a certain file path, this file path should point to a .yml file that conforms to the following format:

```yaml
tests:
  - name: >-
      test_run_job_with_sensitive_variables_and_requires_approval
      (nautobot.extras.tests.test_views.JobTestCase)
    execution_time: 4.799533
  - name: test_run_missing_schedule (nautobot.extras.tests.test_views.JobTestCase)
    execution_time: 4.367563
  - name: test_run_now_missing_args (nautobot.extras.tests.test_views.JobTestCase)
    execution_time: 4.363194
  - name: >-
      test_create_object_with_constrained_permission
      (nautobot.extras.tests.test_views.GraphQLQueriesTestCase)
    execution_time: 3.474244
  - name: >-
      test_run_now_constrained_permissions
      (nautobot.extras.tests.test_views.JobTestCase)
    execution_time: 2.727531
...
```

and store the performance baselines with the `name` of the test and the baseline `execution_time`. This file should provide the baseline times that all performance-related tests are running against.

---

## UI_RACK_VIEW_TRUNCATE_FUNCTION

+++ 1.4.0

Default:

```py
def UI_RACK_VIEW_TRUNCATE_FUNCTION(device_display_name):
    return str(device_display_name).split(".")[0]
```

This setting function is used to perform the rack elevation truncation feature. This provides a way to tailor the truncation behavior to best suit the needs of the installation.

The function must take only one argument: the device display name, as a string, attempting to be rendered on the rack elevation.

The function must return only one argument: a string of the truncated device display name.

## Environment-Variable-Only Settings

!!! warning
    The following settings are **only** configurable as environment variables, and not via `nautobot_config.py` or similar.

---

### GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY

Default: Unset

If you are using a self-signed git repository, you will need to set the environment variable `GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY="1"`
in order for the repository to sync.

!!! warning
    This _must_ be specified as an environment variable. Setting it in `nautobot_config.py` will not have the desired effect.

---

## NAUTOBOT_LOG_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS

+++ 1.5.2

+/- 1.5.3
    This was previously available as a config file setting but changed to environment-variable only. Also `DEBUG = True` will no longer work to log deprecation warnings.

Default: `False`

This can be set to `True` to allow deprecation warnings raised by Nautobot to (additionally) be logged as `WARNING` level log messages. (Deprecation warnings are normally silent in Python, but can be enabled globally by [various means](https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html) such as setting the `PYTHONWARNINGS` environment variable. However, doing so can be rather noisy, as it will also include warnings from within Django about various code in various package dependencies of Nautobot's, etc. This configuration setting allows a more targeted enablement of only warnings from within Nautobot itself, which can be useful when vetting various Nautobot apps (plugins) for future-proofness against upcoming changes to Nautobot.)

!!! caution
    In Nautobot 2.0, deprecation warnings will be logged by default; a future release of Nautobot 1.5.x will also enable default logging of deprecation warnings.

---

### NAUTOBOT_ROOT

Default: `~/.nautobot/`

The filesystem path to use to store Nautobot files (Jobs, uploaded images, Git repositories, etc.).

This setting is used internally in the core settings to provide default locations for [features that require file storage](index.md#file-storage), and the [default location of the `nautobot_config.py`](index.md#specifying-your-configuration).

!!! warning
    Do not override `NAUTOBOT_ROOT` in your `nautobot_config.py`. It will not work as expected. If you need to customize this setting, please always set the `NAUTOBOT_ROOT` environment variable.

## Django Configuration Settings

While the [official Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/) documents all Django settings, the below is provided where either the setting is common in Nautobot deployments and/or there is a supported `NAUTOBOT_*` environment variable.

### ADMINS

Default: `[]` (Empty list)

Nautobot will email details about critical errors to the administrators listed here. This should be a list of (name, email) tuples. For example:

```python
ADMINS = [
    ['Hank Hill', 'hhill@example.com'],
    ['Dale Gribble', 'dgribble@example.com'],
]
```

Please see the [official Django documentation on `ADMINS`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#admins) for more information.

---

### CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS

Default: `[]`

A list of hosts (fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs) or subdomains) that are considered trusted origins for cross-site secure requests such as HTTPS POST.

For more information, please see the [official Django documentation on `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#csrf-trusted-origins) and more generally the [official Django documentation on CSRF protection](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/csrf/#how-it-works)

---

### Date and Time Formatting

You may define custom formatting for date and times. For detailed instructions on writing format strings, please see [the Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/templates/builtins/#date). Default formats are listed below.

```python
DATE_FORMAT = 'N j, Y'               # June 26, 2016
SHORT_DATE_FORMAT = 'Y-m-d'          # 2016-06-26
TIME_FORMAT = 'g:i a'                # 1:23 p.m.
DATETIME_FORMAT = 'N j, Y g:i a'     # June 26, 2016 1:23 p.m.
SHORT_DATETIME_FORMAT = 'Y-m-d H:i'  # 2016-06-26 13:23
```

Environment Variables:

* `NAUTOBOT_DATE_FORMAT`
* `NAUTOBOT_SHORT_DATE_FORMAT`
* `NAUTOBOT_TIME_FORMAT`
* `NAUTOBOT_SHORT_TIME_FORMAT`
* `NAUTOBOT_DATETIME_FORMAT`
* `NAUTOBOT_SHORT_DATETIME_FORMAT`

---

### DEBUG

Default: `False`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_DEBUG`

This setting enables debugging. Debugging should be enabled only during development or troubleshooting. Note that only
clients which access Nautobot from a recognized [internal IP address](#internal_ips) will see debugging tools in the user interface.

!!! warning
    Never enable debugging on a production system, as it can expose sensitive data to unauthenticated users and impose a
    substantial performance penalty.

Please see the [official Django documentation on `DEBUG`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#debug) for more information.

---

### FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME

Default: `None`

If not `None`, this will be used as the value of the `SCRIPT_NAME` environment variable in any HTTP request. This setting can be used to override the server-provided value of `SCRIPT_NAME`, which is most commonly used for hosting Nautobot in a subdirectory (e.g. _example.com/nautobot/_).

!!! important
    To host Nautobot under a subdirectory you must set this value to match the same prefix configured on your HTTP server. For example, if you configure NGINX to serve Nautobot at `/nautobot/`, you must set `FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME = "/nautobot/"`.

Please see the [official Django documentation on `FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#force-script-name) for more information.

---

### INTERNAL_IPS

Default: `('127.0.0.1', '::1')`

A list of IP addresses recognized as internal to the system, used to control the display of debugging output. For
example, the [Django debugging toolbar](https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/), if installed,
will be viewable only when a client is accessing Nautobot from one of the listed IP
addresses (and [`DEBUG`](#debug) is true).

---

### LOGGING

Default:

```python
{
    "version": 1,
    "disable_existing_loggers": False,
    "formatters": {
        "normal": {
            "format": "%(asctime)s.%(msecs)03d %(levelname)-7s %(name)s :\n  %(message)s",
            "datefmt": "%H:%M:%S",
        },
        "verbose": {
            "format": "%(asctime)s.%(msecs)03d %(levelname)-7s %(name)-20s %(filename)-15s %(funcName)30s() :\n  %(message)s",
            "datefmt": "%H:%M:%S",
        },
    },
    "handlers": {
        "normal_console": {
            "level": "INFO",
            "class": "logging.StreamHandler",
            "formatter": "normal",
        },
        "verbose_console": {
            "level": "DEBUG",
            "class": "logging.StreamHandler",
            "formatter": "verbose",
        },
    },
    "loggers": {
        "django": {"handlers": ["normal_console"], "level": "INFO"},
        "nautobot": {
            "handlers": ["verbose_console" if DEBUG else "normal_console"],
            "level": LOG_LEVEL,
        },
    },
}
```

+/- 1.4.10
    While running unit or integration tests via `nautobot-server test ...`, LOGGING will be set to `{}` instead of the above defaults, as verbose logging to the console is typically not desirable while running tests.

This translates to:

* all messages from Django and from Nautobot of INFO severity or higher will be logged to the console.
* if [`DEBUG`](#debug) is True, Nautobot DEBUG messages will also be logged, and all Nautobot messages will be logged with a more verbose format including the filename and function name that originated each log message.

The above default log formatters split each log message across two lines of output for greater readability, which is useful for local observation and troubleshooting, but you may find it impractical to use in production environments that expect one line per log message. Fortunately, the Django framework on which Nautobot runs allows for extensive customization of logging format and destination. Please consult the [Django logging documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/logging/) for more information on configuring this setting.

Below is an example configuration extension which will additionally write all INFO and higher messages to a local file:

```python
LOGGING["handlers"]["file"] = {
    "level": "INFO",
    "class": "logging.FileHandler",
    "filename": "/var/log/nautobot.log",
    "formatter": "normal",
}
LOGGING["loggers"]["django"]["handlers"] += ["file"]
LOGGING["loggers"]["nautobot"]["handlers"] += ["file"]
```

Additional examples are available in the [`/examples/logging`](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/tree/develop/examples/logging) directory in the Nautobot repository.

#### Available Loggers

* `django.*` - Generic Django operations (HTTP requests/responses, etc.)
* `nautobot.<app>.<module>` - Generic form for model- or module-specific log messages
* `nautobot.auth.*` - Authentication events
* `nautobot.jobs.*` - Job execution (`* = JobClassName`)
* `nautobot.graphql.*` - [GraphQL](../additional-features/graphql.md) initialization and operation.
* `nautobot.plugins.*` - Plugin loading and activity
* `nautobot.views.*` - Views which handle business logic for the web UI

---

### MEDIA_ROOT

Default: `os.path.join(NAUTOBOT_ROOT, "media")`

The file path to the location where media files (such as [image attachments](../models/extras/imageattachment.md)) are stored.

Please see the [official Django documentation on `MEDIA_ROOT`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#media-root) for more information.

---

### SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE

Default: `False`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE`

If this is set to True, Nautobot will use browser-length cookies - cookies that expire as soon as the user closes their browser.

By default, `SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE` is set to False, which means session cookies will be stored in users’ browsers for as long as [`SESSION_COOKIE_AGE`](#session_cookie_age).

Please see the [official Django documentation on `SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#session-expire-at-browser-close) for more information.

---

### SESSION_COOKIE_AGE

Default: `1209600` (2 weeks, in seconds)

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_SESSION_COOKIE_AGE`

The age of session cookies, in seconds.

Please see the [official Django documentation on `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#session-cookie-age) for more information.

---

### SESSION_ENGINE

Default: `'django.contrib.sessions.backends.db'`

Controls where Nautobot stores session data.

To use cache-based sessions, set this to `'django.contrib.sessions.backends.cache'`.
To use file-based sessions, set this to `'django.contrib.sessions.backends.file'`.

See the official Django documentation on [Configuring the session](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/http/sessions/#configuring-sessions) engine for more details.

---

### SESSION_FILE_PATH

Default: `None`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_SESSION_FILE_PATH`

HTTP session data is used to track authenticated users when they access Nautobot. By default, Nautobot stores session data in its database. However, this inhibits authentication to a standby instance of Nautobot without write access to the database. Alternatively, a local file path may be specified here and Nautobot will store session data as files instead of using the database. Note that the Nautobot system user must have read and write permissions to this path.

When the default value (`None`) is used, Nautobot will use the standard temporary directory for the system.

If you set this value, you must also enable file-based sessions as explained above using [`SESSION_ENGINE`](#session_engine).

---

### STATIC_ROOT

Default: `os.path.join(NAUTOBOT_ROOT, "static")`

The location where static files (such as CSS, JavaScript, fonts, or images) used to serve the web interface will be staged by the `nautobot-server collectstatic` command.

Please see the [official Django documentation on `STATIC_ROOT`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#std:setting-STATIC_ROOT) for more information.

---

### TIME_ZONE

Default: `"UTC"`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_TIME_ZONE`

The time zone Nautobot will use when dealing with dates and times. It is recommended to use UTC time unless you have a specific need to use a local time zone. Please see the [list of available time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

Please see the [official Django documentation on `TIME_ZONE`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#time-zone) for more information.



----- FILE: nautobot_docs_additional-features_jobs.md (OLD) -----
# Jobs

Jobs are a way for users to execute custom logic on demand from within the Nautobot UI. Jobs can interact directly with Nautobot data to accomplish various data creation, modification, and validation tasks, such as:

* Automatically populate new devices and cables in preparation for a new site deployment
* Create a range of new reserved prefixes or IP addresses
* Fetch data from an external source and import it to Nautobot
* Check and report whether all top-of-rack switches have a console connection
* Check and report whether every router has a loopback interface with an assigned IP address
* Check and report whether all IP addresses have a parent prefix

...and so on. Jobs are Python code and exist outside of the official Nautobot code base, so they can be updated and changed without interfering with the core Nautobot installation. And because they're completely customizable, there's practically no limit to what a job can accomplish.

!!! note
    Jobs unify and supersede the functionality previously provided in NetBox by "custom scripts" and "reports". Jobs are backwards-compatible for now with the `Script` and `Report` class APIs, but you are urged to move to the new `Job` class API described below. Jobs may be optionally marked as [read-only](#read_only) which equates to the `Report` functionally, but in all cases, user input is supported via [job variables](#variables).

## Writing Jobs

Jobs may be installed in one of three ways:

* Manually installed as files in the [`JOBS_ROOT`](../configuration/optional-settings.md#jobs_root) path (which defaults to `$NAUTOBOT_ROOT/jobs/`).
    * The `JOBS_ROOT` directory *must* contain a file named `__init__.py`. Do not delete this file.
    * Each file created within this path is considered a separate module; there is no support for cross-file dependencies (such as a file acting as a common "library" module of functions shared between jobs) for files installed in this way.
* Imported from an external [Git repository](../models/extras/gitrepository.md#jobs).
    * The repository's `jobs/` directory *must* contain a file named `__init__.py`.
    * Each Job file in the repository is considered a separate module; there is no support for cross-file dependencies (such as a file acting as a common "library" module of functions shared between jobs) for files installed in this way.
* Packaged as part of a [plugin](../plugins/development.md#including-jobs).
    * Jobs installed this way are part of the plugin module and can import code from elsewhere in the plugin or even have dependencies on other packages, if needed, via the standard Python packaging mechanisms.

In any case, each module holds one or more Jobs (Python classes), each of which serves a specific purpose. The logic of each job can be split into a number of distinct methods, each of which performs a discrete portion of the overall job logic.

For example, we can create a module named `devices.py` to hold all of our jobs which pertain to devices in Nautobot. Within that module, we might define several jobs. Each job is defined as a Python class inheriting from `extras.jobs.Job`, which provides the base functionality needed to accept user input and log activity.

!!! warning
    Make sure you are *not* inheriting `extras.jobs.models.Job` instead, otherwise Django will think you want to define a new database model.

```python
from nautobot.extras.jobs import Job

class CreateDevices(Job):
    ...

class DeviceConnectionsReport(Job):
    ...

class DeviceIPsReport(Job):
    ...
```

Each job class will implement some or all of the following components:

* Module and class attributes, providing for default behavior, documentation and discoverability
* a set of variables for user input via the Nautobot UI (if your job requires any user inputs)
* a `run()` method, which is executed first and receives the user input values, if any
* any number of `test_*()` methods, which will be invoked next in order of declaration. Log messages generated by the job will be grouped together by the test method they were invoked from.
* a `post_run()` method, which is executed last and can be used to handle any necessary cleanup or final events (such as sending an email or triggering a webhook). The status of the overall job is available at this time as `self.failed` and the `JobResult` data object is available as `self.result`.

You can implement the entire job within the `run()` function, but for more complex jobs, you may want to provide more granularity in the output and logging of activity. For this purpose, you can implement portions of the logic as `test_*()` methods (i.e., methods whose name begins with `test_*`) and/or a `post_run()` method. Log messages generated by the job logging APIs (more below on this topic) will be grouped together according to their base method (`run`, `test_a`, `test_b`, ..., `post_run`) which can aid in understanding the operation of the job.

!!! note
    Your job can of course define additional Python methods to compartmentalize and reuse logic as required; however the `run`, `test_*`, and `post_run` methods are the only ones that will be automatically invoked by Nautobot.

It's important to understand that jobs execute on the server asynchronously as background tasks; they log messages and report their status to the database by updating [`JobResult`](../models/extras/jobresult.md) records and creating [`JobLogEntry`](../models/extras/joblogentry.md) records.

!!! note
    When actively developing a Job utilizing a development environment it's important to understand that the "automatically reload when code changes are detected" debugging functionality provided by `nautobot-server runserver` does **not** automatically restart the Celery `worker` process when code changes are made; therefore, it is required to restart the `worker` after each update to your Job source code or else it will continue to run the version of the Job code that was present when it first started.

    Additionally, as of Nautobot 1.3, the Job database records corresponding to installed Jobs are *not* automatically refreshed when the development server auto-restarts. If you make changes to any of the class and module metadata attributes described in the following sections, the database will be refreshed to reflect these changes only after running `nautobot-server migrate` or `nautobot-server post_upgrade` (recommended) or if you manually edit a Job database record to force it to be refreshed.

### Module Metadata Attributes

#### `name` (Grouping)

You can define a global constant called `name` within a job module (the Python file which contains one or more job classes) to set the default grouping under which jobs in this module will be displayed in the Nautobot UI. If this value is not defined, the module's file name will be used. This "grouping" value may also be defined or overridden when editing Job records in the database.

!!! note
    In some UI elements and API endpoints, the module file name is displayed in addition to or in place of this attribute, so even if defining this attribute, you should still choose an appropriately explanatory file name as well.

### Class Metadata Attributes

Job-specific attributes may be defined under a class named `Meta` within each job class you implement. All of these are optional, but encouraged.

#### `name`

This is the human-friendly name of your job, as will be displayed in the Nautobot UI. If not set, the class name will be used.

!!! note
    In some UI elements and API endpoints, the class name is displayed in addition to or in place of this attribute, so even if defining this attribute, you should still choose an appropriately explanatory class name as well.

#### `description`

An optional human-friendly description of what this job does.
This can accept either plain text or Markdown-formatted text. It can also be multiple lines:

```python
class ExampleJob(Job):
    class Meta:
        description = """
            This job does a number of interesting things.

             1. It hacks the Gibson
             2. It immanentizes the eschaton
             3. It's a floor wax *and* a dessert topping
        """
```

If you code a multi-line description, the first line only will be used in the description column of the jobs list, while the full description will be rendered in the job detail view, submission, approval, and results pages.

#### `approval_required`

Default: `False`

A boolean that will mark this job as requiring approval from another user to be run. For more details on approvals, [please refer to the section on scheduling and approvals](./job-scheduling-and-approvals.md).

#### `commit_default`

Default: `True`

The checkbox to commit database changes when executing a job is checked by default in the Nautobot UI. You can set `commit_default` to `False` under the `Meta` class if you want this option to instead be unchecked by default.

```python
class MyJob(Job):
    class Meta:
        commit_default = False
```

#### `field_order`

Default: `[]`

A list of strings (field names) representing the order your job [variables](#variables) should be rendered as form fields in the job submission UI. If not defined, the variables will be listed in order of their definition in the code. If variables are defined on a parent class and no field order is defined, the parent class variables will appear before the subclass variables.

#### `has_sensitive_variables`

+++ 1.3.10

Default: `True`

Unless set to False, it prevents the job's input parameters from being saved to the database. This defaults to True so as to protect against inadvertent database exposure of input parameters that may include sensitive data such as passwords or other user credentials. Review whether each job's inputs contain any such variables before setting this to False; if a job *does* contain sensitive inputs, if possible you should consider whether the job could be re-implemented using Nautobot's [`Secrets`](../core-functionality/secrets.md) feature as a way to ensure that the sensitive data is not directly provided as a job variable at all.

Important notes about jobs with sensitive variables:

* Such jobs cannot be scheduled to run in the future or on a recurring schedule (as scheduled jobs must by necessity store their variables in the database for future reference).
* Jobs with sensitive variables cannot be marked as requiring approval (as jobs pending approval must store their variables in the database until approved).

#### `hidden`

Default: `False`

A Boolean that if set to `True` prevents the job from being displayed by default in the list of Jobs in the Nautobot UI.

Since the jobs execution framework is designed to be generic, there may be several technical jobs defined by users which interact with or are invoked by external systems. In such cases, these jobs are not meant to be executed by a human and likely do not make sense to expose to end users for execution, and thus having them exposed in the UI at all is extraneous.

Important notes about hidden jobs:

* This is merely hiding them by default from the web interface. It is NOT a security feature.
* In the Jobs list view it is possible to filter to "Hidden: (no selection)" or even "Hidden: Yes" to list the hidden jobs.
* All Job UI and REST API endpoints still exist for hidden jobs and can be accessed by any user who is aware of their existence.
* Hidden jobs can still be executed through the UI or the REST API given the appropriate URL.
* Results for hidden jobs will still appear in the Job Results list after they are run.

#### `read_only`

+++ 1.1.0

Default: `False`

A boolean that designates whether the job is able to make changes to data in the database. The value defaults to `False` but when set to `True`, any data modifications executed from the job's code will be automatically aborted at the end of the job. The job input form is also modified to remove the `commit` checkbox as it is irrelevant for read-only jobs. When a job is marked as read-only, log messages that are normally automatically emitted about the DB transaction state are not included because no changes to data are allowed. Note that user input may still be optionally collected with read-only jobs via job variables, as described below.

#### `soft_time_limit`

+++ 1.3.0

An int or float value, in seconds, which can be used to override the default [soft time limit](../configuration/optional-settings.md#celery_task_soft_time_limit) for a job task to complete.

The `celery.exceptions.SoftTimeLimitExceeded` exception will be raised when this soft time limit is exceeded. The job task can catch this to clean up before the [hard time limit](../configuration/optional-settings.md#celery_task_time_limit) (10 minutes by default) is reached:

```python
from celery.exceptions import SoftTimeLimitExceeded
from nautobot.extras.jobs import Job

class ExampleJobWithSoftTimeLimit(Job):
    class Meta:
        name = "Soft Time Limit"
        description = "Set a soft time limit of 10 seconds`"
        soft_time_limit = 10

    def run(self, data, commit):
        try:
            # code which might take longer than 10 seconds to run
            job_code()
        except SoftTimeLimitExceeded:
            # any clean up code
            cleanup_in_a_hurry()
```

#### `task_queues`

+++ 1.5.0

Default: `[]`

A list of task queue names that the job can be routed to. An empty list will default to only allowing the user to select the [default queue](../configuration/optional-settings.md#celery_task_default_queue) (`default` unless changed by an administrator). The first queue in the list will be used if a queue is not specified in a job run API call.

!!! note
    A worker must be listening on the requested queue or the job will not run. See the documentation on [task queues](../administration/celery-queues.md) for more information.

#### `template_name`

+++ 1.4.0

A path relative to the job source code containing a Django template which provides additional code to customize the Job's submission form. This template should extend the existing job template, `extras/job.html`, otherwise the base form and functionality may not be available.

A template can provide additional JavaScript, CSS, or even display HTML. A good starting template would be:

```html
{% extends 'extras/job.html' %}

{% block extra_styles %}
    {{ block.super }}
    <!-- Add additional CSS here. -->
{% endblock %}
{% block content %}
    {{ block.super }}
    <!-- Add additional HTML here. -->
{% endblock content %}
{% block javascript %}
    {{ block.super }}
    <!-- Add additional JavaScript here. -->
{% endblock javascript %}
```

For another example checkout [the template used in example plugin](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/blob/next/examples/example_plugin/example_plugin/templates/example_plugin/example_with_custom_template.html) in the GitHub repo.

#### `time_limit`

+++ 1.3.0

An int or float value, in seconds, which can be used to override the
default [hard time limit](../configuration/optional-settings.md#celery_task_time_limit) (10 minutes by default) for a job task to complete.

Unlike the `soft_time_limit` above, no exceptions are raised when a `time_limit` is exceeded. The task will just terminate silently:

```python
from nautobot.extras.jobs import Job

class ExampleJobWithHardTimeLimit(Job):
    class Meta:
        name = "Hard Time Limit"
        description = "Set a hard time limit of 10 seconds`"
        time_limit = 10

    def run(self, data, commit):
        # code which might take longer than 10 seconds to run
        # this code will fail silently if the time_limit is exceeded
        job_code()
```

!!! note
    If the `time_limit` is set to a value less than or equal to the `soft_time_limit`, a warning log is generated to inform the user that this job will fail silently after the `time_limit` as the `soft_time_limit` will never be reached.

### Variables

Variables allow your job to accept user input via the Nautobot UI, but they are optional; if your job does not require any user input, there is no need to define any variables. Conversely, if you are making use of user input in your job, you *must* also implement the `run()` method, as it is the only entry point to your job that has visibility into the variable values provided by the user.

```python
from nautobot.extras.jobs import Job, StringVar, IntegerVar, ObjectVar

class CreateDevices(Job):
    var1 = StringVar(...)
    var2 = IntegerVar(...)
    var3 = ObjectVar(...)

    def run(self, data, commit):
        ...
```

The remainder of this section documents the various supported variable types and how to make use of them.

#### Default Variable Options

All job variables support the following default options:

* `default` - The field's default value
* `description` - A brief user-friendly description of the field
* `label` - The field name to be displayed in the rendered form
* `required` - Indicates whether the field is mandatory (all fields are required by default)
* `widget` - The class of form widget to use (see the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/forms/widgets/))

#### `StringVar`

Stores a string of characters (i.e. text). Options include:

* `min_length` - Minimum number of characters
* `max_length` - Maximum number of characters
* `regex` - A regular expression against which the provided value must match

Note that `min_length` and `max_length` can be set to the same number to effect a fixed-length field.

#### `TextVar`

Arbitrary text of any length. Renders as a multi-line text input field.

#### `IntegerVar`

Stores a numeric integer. Options include:

* `min_value` - Minimum value
* `max_value` - Maximum value

#### `BooleanVar`

A true/false flag. This field has no options beyond the defaults listed above.

#### `ChoiceVar`

A set of choices from which the user can select one.

* `choices` - A list of `(value, label)` tuples representing the available choices. For example:

```python
CHOICES = (
    ('n', 'North'),
    ('s', 'South'),
    ('e', 'East'),
    ('w', 'West')
)

direction = ChoiceVar(choices=CHOICES)
```

In the example above, selecting the choice labeled "North" will submit the value `n`.

#### `MultiChoiceVar`

Similar to `ChoiceVar`, but allows for the selection of multiple choices.

#### `ObjectVar`

A particular object within Nautobot. Each ObjectVar must specify a particular model, and allows the user to select one of the available instances. ObjectVar accepts several arguments, listed below.

* `model` - The model class
* `display_field` - The name of the REST API object field to display in the selection list (default: `'display'`)
* `query_params` - A dictionary of REST API query parameters to use when retrieving available options (optional)
* `null_option` - A label representing a "null" or empty choice (optional)

The `display_field` argument is useful in cases where using the `display` API field is not desired for referencing the object. For example, when displaying a list of IP Addresses, you might want to use the `dns_name` field:

```python
device_type = ObjectVar(
    model=IPAddress,
    display_field="dns_name",
)
```

To limit the selections available within the list, additional query parameters can be passed as the `query_params` dictionary. For example, to show only devices with an "active" status:

```python
device = ObjectVar(
    model=Device,
    query_params={
        'status': 'active'
    }
)
```

Multiple values can be specified by assigning a list to the dictionary key. It is also possible to reference the value of other fields in the form by prepending a dollar sign (`$`) to the variable's name. The keys you can use in this dictionary are the same ones that are available in the REST API - as an example it is also possible to filter the `Site` `ObjectVar` for its `tenant_group_id`.

```python
region = ObjectVar(
    model=Region
)
tenant_group = ObjectVar(
    model=TenantGroup
)
site = ObjectVar(
    model=Site,
    query_params={
        'region_id': '$region',
        'tenant_group_id': '$tenant_group'
    }
)
```

#### `MultiObjectVar`

Similar to `ObjectVar`, but allows for the selection of multiple objects.

#### `FileVar`

An uploaded file. Note that uploaded files are present in memory only for the duration of the job's execution: They will not be automatically saved for future use. The job is responsible for writing file contents to disk where necessary.

#### `IPAddressVar`

An IPv4 or IPv6 address, without a mask. Returns a `netaddr.IPAddress` object.

#### `IPAddressWithMaskVar`

An IPv4 or IPv6 address with a mask. Returns a `netaddr.IPNetwork` object which includes the mask.

#### `IPNetworkVar`

An IPv4 or IPv6 network with a mask. Returns a `netaddr.IPNetwork` object. Two attributes are available to validate the provided mask:

* `min_prefix_length` - Minimum length of the mask
* `max_prefix_length` - Maximum length of the mask

### The `run()` Method

The `run()` method, if you choose to implement it, should accept two arguments:

1. `data` - A dictionary which will contain all of the variable data passed in by the user (via the web UI or REST API)
2. `commit` - A boolean indicating whether database changes should be committed. If this is `False`, even if your Job attempts to make database changes, they will be automatically rolled back when the Job completes.

```python
from nautobot.extras.jobs import Job, StringVar, IntegerVar, ObjectVar

class CreateDevices(Job):
    var1 = StringVar(...)
    var2 = IntegerVar(...)
    var3 = ObjectVar(...)

    def run(self, data, commit):
        ...
```

Again, defining user variables is totally optional; you may create a job with just a `run()` method if no user input is needed, in which case `data` will be an empty dictionary.

!!! note
    The `test_*()` and `post_run()` methods do not accept any arguments; if you need to access user `data` or the `commit` flag, your `run()` method is responsible for storing these values in the job instance, such as:

    ```
    def run(self, data, commit):
        self.data = data
        self.commit = commit
    ```

!!! warning
    When writing Jobs that create and manipulate data it is recommended to make use of the `validated_save()` convenience method which exists on all core models. This method saves the instance data but first enforces model validation logic. Simply calling `save()` on the model instance **does not** enforce validation automatically and may lead to bad data. See the development [best practices](../development/best-practices.md).

!!! warning
    The Django ORM provides methods to create/edit many objects at once, namely `bulk_create()` and `update()`. These are best avoided in most cases as they bypass a model's built-in validation and can easily lead to database corruption if not used carefully.

### The `test_*()` Methods

If your job class defines any number of methods whose names begin with `test_`, these will be automatically invoked after the `run()` method (if any) completes. These methods must take no arguments (other than `self`).

Log messages generated by any of these methods will be automatically grouped together by the test method they were invoked from, which can be helpful for readability.

### The `post_run()` Method

If your job class implements a `post_run()` method (which must take no arguments other than `self`), this method will be automatically invoked after the `run()` and `test_*()` methods (if any). It will be called even if one of the other methods raises an exception, so this method can be used to handle any necessary cleanup or final events (such as sending an email or triggering a webhook). The status of the overall job is available at this time as `self.failed` and the associated [`JobResult`](../models/extras/jobresult.md) `data` field is available as `self.results`.

### Logging

The following instance methods are available to log results from an executing job to be stored into [`JobLogEntry`](../models/extras/joblogentry.md) records associated with the current [`JobResult`](../models/extras/jobresult.md):

* `self.log(message)`
* `self.log_debug(message)`
* `self.log_success(obj=None, message=None)`
* `self.log_info(obj=None, message=None)`
* `self.log_warning(obj=None, message=None)`
* `self.log_failure(obj=None, message=None)`

Messages recorded with `log()` or `log_debug()` will appear in a job's results but are never associated with a particular object; the other `log_*` functions may be invoked with or without a provided object to associate the message with.

It is advised to log a message for each object that is evaluated so that the results will reflect how many objects are being manipulated or reported on.

Markdown rendering is supported for log messages.

+/- 1.3.4
    As a security measure, the `message` passed to any of these methods will be passed through the `nautobot.utilities.logging.sanitize()` function in an attempt to strip out information such as usernames/passwords that should not be saved to the logs. This is of course best-effort only, and Job authors should take pains to ensure that such information is not passed to the logging APIs in the first place. The set of redaction rules used by the `sanitize()` function can be configured as [settings.SANITIZER_PATTERNS](../configuration/optional-settings.md#sanitizer_patterns).

!!! note
    Using `self.log_failure()`, in addition to recording a log message, will flag the overall job as failed, but it will **not** stop the execution of the job, nor will it result in an automatic rollback of any database changes made by the job. To end a job early, you can use a Python `raise` or `return` as appropriate. Raising any exception (e.g. `ValueError` for malformed input values) will ensure that any database changes are rolled back as part of the process of ending the job. `AbortTransaction` from Nautobot, which was recommended in past versions of the docs, should explicitly *not* be used, as it is only intended for use by Nautobot's internal job handling.

### Accessing Request Data

Details of the current HTTP request (the one being made to execute the job) are available as the instance attribute `self.request`. This can be used to infer, for example, the user executing the job and their client IP address:

```python
username = self.request.user.username
ip_address = self.request.META.get('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR') or \
    self.request.META.get('REMOTE_ADDR')
self.log_info(f"Running as user {username} (IP: {ip_address})...")
```

For a complete list of available request parameters, please see the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/request-response/).

### Reading Data from Files

The `Job` class provides two convenience methods for reading data from files:

* `load_yaml`
* `load_json`

These two methods will load data in YAML or JSON format, respectively, from files within the local path (i.e. `JOBS_ROOT/`).

## Managing Jobs

As of Nautobot 1.3, each Job class installed in Nautobot is represented by a corresponding Job data record in the Nautobot database. These data records are refreshed when the `nautobot-server migrate` or `nautobot-server post_upgrade` command is run, or (for Jobs from a Git repository) when a Git repository is enabled or re-synced in Nautobot. These data records make it possible for an administrative user (or other user with appropriate access privileges) to exert a level of administrative control over the Jobs created and updated by Job authors.

### Enabling Jobs for Running

When a new Job record is created for a newly discovered Job class, it defaults to `enabled = False`, which prevents the Job from being run by any user. This is intended to provide a level of security and oversight regarding the installation of new Jobs into Nautobot.

!!! important
    One exception to this default is when upgrading from a Nautobot release before 1.3 to Nautobot 1.3.0 or later. In this case, at the time of the upgrade, any Job class that shows evidence of having been run or scheduled under the older Nautobot version (that is, there is at least one JobResult and/or ScheduledJob record that references this Job class) will result in the creation of a Job database record with `enabled = True`. The reasoning for this feature is the assertion that because the Job has been run or scheduled previously, it has presumably already undergone appropriate review at that time, and so it should remain possible to run it as it was possible before the upgrade.

An administrator or user with `extras.change_job` permission can edit the Job to change it to `enabled = True`, permitting running of the Job, when they have completed any appropriate review of the new Job to ensure that it meets their standards. Similarly, an obsolete or no-longer-used Job can be prevented from inadvertent execution by changing it back to `enabled = False`.

 By default when a Job is installed into Nautobot it is installed in a disabled state. In order to enable a Job:

* Navigate to Jobs > Jobs menu
* Select a job that has been installed
* Select **Edit** button
* In the second section titled *Job*, select the **Enabled** checkbox
* Select **Update** button at the bottom

#### Enabling Job Hooks

 Job hooks are enabled in a similar fashion, but by using the *default* filters when navigating to the Jobs page the Job Hooks will not be visible. To enable job hooks:

* Navigate to Jobs > Jobs menu
* Select the **Filter** button to bring up the Filter Jobs context
* Look for **Is job hook receiver** and change the drop down to **Yes**
* Select **Apply** button
* Select a job that has been installed
* Select **Edit** button
* In the second section titled *Job*, select the **Enabled** checkbox
* Select **Update** button at the bottom

### Overriding Metadata

An administrator or user with `extras.change_job` permission can also edit a Job database record to optionally override any or all of the following metadata attributes defined by the Job module or class:

* `grouping`
* `name`
* `description`
* `approval_required`
* `commit_default`
* `has_sensitive_variables`
* `hidden`
* `read_only`
* `soft_time_limit`
* `time_limit`
* `task_queues`

This is done by setting the corresponding "override" flag (`grouping_override`, `name_override`, etc.) to `True` then providing a new value for the attribute in question. An overridden attribute will remain set to its overridden value even if the underlying Job class definition changes and `nautobot-server <migrate|post_upgrade>` gets run again. Conversely, clearing the "override" flag for an attribute and saving the database record will revert the attribute to the underlying value defined within the Job class source code.

### Deleting Jobs

When a previously installed Job class is removed, after running `nautobot-server <migrate|post_upgrade>` or refreshing the providing Git repository, the Job database record will *not* be automatically deleted, but *will* be flagged as `installed = False` and can no longer be run or scheduled.

An administrator or user with `extras.delete_job` permissions *may* delete such a Job database record if desired, but be aware that doing so will result in any existing JobResult or ScheduledJob records that originated from this Job losing their association to the Job; this association will not be automatically restored even if the Job is later reinstalled or reintroduced.

## Running Jobs

!!! note
    To run any job, a user must be assigned the `extras.run_job` permission. This is achieved by assigning the user (or group) a permission on the `extras > job` object and specifying the `run` action in the admin UI as shown below.

    Similarly, to [approve a job request by another user](./job-scheduling-and-approvals.md), a user must be assigned the `extras.approve_job` permission via the same process. Job approvers also need the `extras.change_scheduledjob` and/or `extras.delete_scheduledjob` permissions as job approvals are implemented via the `ScheduledJob` data model.

    ![Adding the run action to a permission](../media/admin_ui_run_permission.png)

### Jobs and `class_path`

It is a key concept to understand the 3 `class_path` elements:

* `grouping_name`: which can be one of `local`, `git`, or `plugins` - depending on where the `Job` has been defined.
* `module_name`: which is the Python path to the job definition file, for a plugin-provided job, this might be something like `my_plugin_name.jobs.my_job_filename` or `nautobot_golden_config.jobs` and is the importable Python path name (which would not include the `.py` extension, as per Python syntax standards).
* `JobClassName`: which is the name of the class inheriting from `nautobot.extras.jobs.Job` contained in the above file.

The `class_path` is often represented as a string in the format of `<grouping_name>/<module_name>/<JobClassName>`, such as
`local/example/MyJobWithNoVars` or `plugins/nautobot_golden_config.jobs/BackupJob`. Understanding the definitions of these
elements will be important in running jobs programmatically.

+/- 1.3.0
    With the addition of Job database models, it is now generally possible and preferable to refer to a job by its UUID primary key, similar to other Nautobot database models, rather than its `class_path`.

### Via the Web UI

Jobs can be run via the web UI by navigating to the job, completing any required form data (if any), and clicking the "Run Job" button.

Once a job has been run, the latest [`JobResult`](../models/extras/jobresult.md) for that job will be summarized in the job list view.

### Via the API

To run a job via the REST API, issue a POST request to the job's endpoint `/api/extras/jobs/<uuid>/run/`. You can optionally provide JSON data to set the `commit` flag, specify any required user input `data`, optional `task_queue`, and/or provide optional scheduling information as described in [the section on scheduling and approvals](./job-scheduling-and-approvals.md).

For example, to run a job with no user inputs and without committing any anything to the database:

```no-highlight
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Token $TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json; version=1.3; indent=4" \
http://nautobot/api/extras/jobs/$JOB_ID/run/
```

Or to run a job that expects user inputs, and commit changes to the database:

```no-highlight
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Token $TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json; version=1.3; indent=4" \
http://nautobot/api/extras/jobs/$JOB_ID/run/ \
--data '{"data": {"string_variable": "somevalue", "integer_variable": 123}, "commit": true}'
```

When providing input data, it is possible to specify complex values contained in `ObjectVar`s, `MultiObjectVar`s, and `IPAddressVar`s.

* `ObjectVar`s can be specified by either using their primary key directly as the value, or as a dictionary containing a more complicated query that gets passed into the Django ORM as keyword arguments.
* `MultiObjectVar`s can be specified as a list of primary keys.
* `IPAddressVar`s can be provided as strings in CIDR notation.

#### Jobs with Files

To run a job that contains `FileVar` inputs via the REST API, you must use `multipart/form-data` content type requests instead of `application/json`. This also requires a slightly different request payload than the example above. The `commit`, `task_queue`, and `schedule` data are flattened and prefixed with underscore to differentiate them from job-specific data. Job specific data is also flattened and not located under the top-level `data` dictionary key.

An example of running a job with both `FileVar` (named `myfile`) and `StringVar` (named `interval`) input:

```no-highlight
curl -X POST \
-H 'Authorization: Token $TOKEN' \
-H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
-H "Accept: application/json; version=1.3; indent=4" \
'http://nautobot/api/extras/jobs/$JOB_ID/run/' \
-F '_commit="true"' \
-F '_schedule_interval="immediately"' \
-F '_schedule_start_time="2022-10-18T17:31:23.698Z"' \
-F 'interval="3"' \
-F 'myfile=@"/path/to/my/file.txt"' \
```

### Via the CLI

Jobs can be run from the CLI by invoking the management command:

```no-highlight
nautobot-server runjob [--username <username>] [--commit] [--local] [--data <data>] <class_path>
```

!!! note
    [See above](#jobs-and-class_path) for `class_path` definitions.

+++ 1.3.10
    The `--data` and `--local` parameters were added.

    The `--data` parameter must be a JSON string, e.g. `--data='{"string_variable": "somevalue", "integer_variable": 123}'`

Using the same example shown in the API:

```no-highlight
nautobot-server runjob --username myusername local/example/MyJobWithNoVars
```

!!! warning
    The `--username <username>` parameter can be used to specify the user that will be identified as the requester of the job. It is optional if the job will not be modifying the database, but is mandatory if you are running with `--commit`, as the specified user will own any resulting database changes.

    Note that `nautobot-server` commands, like all management commands and other direct interactions with the Django database, are not gated by the usual Nautobot user authentication flow. It is possible to specify any existing `--username` with the `nautobot-server runjob` command in order to impersonate any defined user in Nautobot. Use this power wisely and be cautious who you allow to access it.

## Testing Jobs

Jobs are Python code and can be tested as such, usually via [Django unit-test features](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/testing/). That said, there are a few useful tricks specific to testing Jobs.

While individual methods within your Job can and should be tested in isolation, you'll likely also want to test the entire execution of the Job. Nautobot 1.3.3 introduced a few enhancements to make this simpler to do, but it's also quite possible to test in earlier releases with a bit more effort.

### Nautobot 1.3.3 and later

The simplest way to test the entire execution of Jobs from 1.3.3 on is via calling the `nautobot.utilities.testing.run_job_for_testing()` method, which is a helper wrapper around the `run_job` function used to execute a Job via Nautobot's Celery worker process.

Because of the way `run_job_for_testing` and more specifically `run_job()` works, which is somewhat complex behind the scenes, you need to inherit from `nautobot.utilities.testing.TransactionTestCase` instead of `django.test.TestCase` (Refer to the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/testing/tools/#provided-test-case-classes) if you're interested in the differences between these classes - `TransactionTestCase` from Nautobot is a small wrapper around Django's `TransactionTestCase`).

When using `TransactionTestCase` (whether from Django or from Nautobot) each tests runs on a completely empty database. Furthermore, Nautobot requires new jobs to be enabled before they can run. Therefore, we need to make sure the job is enabled before each run which `run_job_for_testing` handles for us.

A simple example of a Job test case for 1.3.3 and forward might look like the following:

```python
from nautobot.extras.models import Job, JobLogEntry
from nautobot.utilities.testing import run_job_for_testing, TransactionTestCase


class MyJobTestCase(TransactionTestCase):
    def test_my_job(self):
        # Testing of Job "MyJob" in file "my_job_file.py" in $JOBS_ROOT
        job = Job.objects.get(job_class_name="MyJob", module_name="my_job_file", source="local")
        # or, job = Job.objects.get_for_class_path("local/my_job_file/MyJob")
        job_result = run_job_for_testing(job, data={}, commit=False)

        # Since we ran with commit=False, any database changes made by the job won't persist,
        # but we can still inspect the logs created by running the job
        log_entries = JobLogEntry.objects.filter(job_result=job_result)
        for log_entry in log_entries:
            self.assertEqual(log_entry.message, "...")
```

!!! tip
    For more advanced examples (such as testing jobs executed with `commit=True`, for example) refer to the Nautobot source code, specifically `nautobot/extras/tests/test_jobs.py`.

### Nautobot 1.3.2 and earlier (including 1.2)

If your test case needs to be backwards-compatible with test execution against Nautobot 1.3.2 and/or earlier, you need to handle a couple more things manually:

Set up the `"job_logs"` database correctly for testing:

```python
from django.conf import settings

if "job_logs" in settings.DATABASES:
    settings.DATABASES["job_logs"] = settings.DATABASES["job_logs"].copy()
    settings.DATABASES["job_logs"]["TEST"] = {"MIRROR": "default"}
```

Replicate the behavior of `run_job_for_testing` manually so that your test execution most closely resembles the way the celery worker would run the test:

```python
import uuid
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType

from nautobot.extras.context_managers import web_request_context
from nautobot.extras.jobs import run_job
from nautobot.extras.models import JobResult, Job

def run_job_for_testing(job, data=None, commit=True, username="test-user"):
    if data is None:
        data = {}
    user_model = get_user_model()
    user, _ = user_model.objects.get_or_create(username=username, is_superuser=True, password="password")
    job_result = JobResult.objects.create(
        name=job.class_path,
        obj_type=ContentType.objects.get_for_model(Job),
        user=user,
        job_id=uuid.uuid4(),
    )
    with web_request_context(user=user) as request:
        run_job(data=data, request=request, commit=commit, job_result_pk=job_result.pk)
    return job_result
```

Setup the `databases` field on the test class correctly, and re-create the default Statuses on `setUp` in your test classes, because `django.test.TransactionTestCase` truncates them on every `tearDown`:

```python
from django.apps import apps
from django.conf import settings
from django.test import TransactionTestCase

from nautobot.extras.management import populate_status_choices

class MyJobTestCase(TransactionTestCase):
    # 'job_logs' is a proxy connection to the same (default) database that's used exclusively for Job logging
    if "job_logs" in settings.DATABASES:
        databases = ("default", "job_logs")

    def setUp(self):
        super().setUp()
        populate_status_choices(apps, None)
```

## Debugging job performance

+++ 1.5.17

Debugging the performance of Nautobot jobs can be tricky, because they are executed in the worker context. In order to gain extra visibility, [cProfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html) can be used to profile the job execution.

The 'profile' form field on jobs is automatically available when the `DEBUG` settings is `True`. When you select that checkbox, a profiling report in the pstats format will be written to the file system of the environment where the job runs. Normally, this is on the file system of the worker process, but if you are using the `nautobot-server runjob` command with `--local`, it will end up in the file system of the web application itself. The path of the written file will be logged in the job.

!!! note
    If you need to run this in an environment where `DEBUG` is `False`, you have the option of using `nautobot-server runjob` with the `--profile` flag. According to the docs, `cProfile` should have minimal impact on the performance of the job; still, proceed with caution when using this in a production environment.

### Reading profiling reports

A full description on how to deal with the output of `cProfile` can be found in the [Instant User's Manual](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#instant-user-s-manual), but here is something to get you started:

```python
import pstats
job_result_uuid = "66b70231-002f-412b-8cc4-1cc9609c2c9b"
stats = pstats.Stats(f"/tmp/job-result-{job_result_uuid}.pstats")
stats.sort_stats(pstats.SortKey.CUMULATIVE).print_stats(10)
```

This will print the 10 functions that the job execution spent the most time in - adapt this to your needs!

## Example Jobs

### Creating objects for a planned site

This job prompts the user for three variables:

* The name of the new site
* The device model (a filtered list of defined device types)
* The number of access switches to create

These variables are presented as a web form to be completed by the user. Once submitted, the job's `run()` method is called to create the appropriate objects, and it returns simple CSV output to the user summarizing the created objects.

```python
from django.utils.text import slugify

from nautobot.dcim.models import Device, DeviceRole, DeviceType, Manufacturer, Site
from nautobot.extras.models import Status
from nautobot.extras.jobs import *


class NewBranch(Job):

    class Meta:
        name = "New Branch"
        description = "Provision a new branch site"
        field_order = ['site_name', 'switch_count', 'switch_model']

    site_name = StringVar(
        description="Name of the new site"
    )
    switch_count = IntegerVar(
        description="Number of access switches to create"
    )
    manufacturer = ObjectVar(
        model=Manufacturer,
        required=False
    )
    switch_model = ObjectVar(
        description="Access switch model",
        model=DeviceType,
        query_params={
            'manufacturer_id': '$manufacturer'
        }
    )

    def run(self, data, commit):
        STATUS_PLANNED = Status.objects.get(slug='planned')

        # Create the new site
        site = Site(
            name=data['site_name'],
            slug=slugify(data['site_name']),
            status=STATUS_PLANNED,
        )
        site.validated_save()
        self.log_success(obj=site, message="Created new site")

        # Create access switches
        switch_role = DeviceRole.objects.get(name='Access Switch')
        for i in range(1, data['switch_count'] + 1):
            switch = Device(
                device_type=data['switch_model'],
                name=f'{site.slug}-switch{i}',
                site=site,
                status=STATUS_PLANNED,
                device_role=switch_role
            )
            switch.validated_save()
            self.log_success(obj=switch, message="Created new switch")

        # Generate a CSV table of new devices
        output = [
            'name,make,model'
        ]
        for switch in Device.objects.filter(site=site):
            attrs = [
                switch.name,
                switch.device_type.manufacturer.name,
                switch.device_type.model
            ]
            output.append(','.join(attrs))

        return '\n'.join(output)
```

### Device validation

A job to perform various validation of Device data in Nautobot. As this job does not require any user input, it does not define any variables, nor does it implement a `run()` method.

```python
from nautobot.dcim.models import ConsolePort, Device, PowerPort
from nautobot.extras.models import Status
from nautobot.extras.jobs import Job


class DeviceConnectionsReport(Job):
    description = "Validate the minimum physical connections for each device"

    def test_console_connection(self):
        STATUS_ACTIVE = Status.objects.get(slug='active')

        # Check that every console port for every active device has a connection defined.
        for console_port in ConsolePort.objects.prefetch_related('device').filter(device__status=STATUS_ACTIVE):
            if console_port.connected_endpoint is None:
                self.log_failure(
                    obj=console_port.device,
                    message="No console connection defined for {}".format(console_port.name)
                )
            elif not console_port.connection_status:
                self.log_warning(
                    obj=console_port.device,
                    message="Console connection for {} marked as planned".format(console_port.name)
                )
            else:
                self.log_success(obj=console_port.device)

    def test_power_connections(self):
        STATUS_ACTIVE = Status.objects.get(slug='active')

        # Check that every active device has at least two connected power supplies.
        for device in Device.objects.filter(status=STATUS_ACTIVE):
            connected_ports = 0
            for power_port in PowerPort.objects.filter(device=device):
                if power_port.connected_endpoint is not None:
                    connected_ports += 1
                    if not power_port.connection_status:
                        self.log_warning(
                            obj=device,
                            message="Power connection for {} marked as planned".format(power_port.name)
                        )
            if connected_ports < 2:
                self.log_failure(
                    obj=device,
                    message="{} connected power supplies found (2 needed)".format(connected_ports)
                )
            else:
                self.log_success(obj=device)
```

# Additional Template Filters

## Introduction

Nautobot uses 2 template engines internally, Django Template and Jinja2. Django Template is used to render the UI pages and Jinja2 is used for features such as computed fields, custom links, export templates, etc.

!!! note
    Jinja2 and Django Template are very similar, the main difference between them is the syntax of the template. Historically, Django Template has been the go-to solution to generate webpage in Django and Jinja2 is the industry standard outside of Django.

Both Django Template and Jinja2 can be extended with a library of functions, called `filters`, that apply formatting or transformations to a provided input. Nautobot provides many built-in `filters`, including network specific `filters` from the [netutils library](https://netutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Netutils Filters

+++ 1.2.0

[Netutils](https://netutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is an external library, maintained by Network to Code, that is focusing on providing a collection of functions for common network automation tasks. Please [check the netutils documentation](https://netutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to see the list of available functions.

These functions are available automatically in Jinja2 rendered by Nautobot. For example you could define a [computed field](../models/extras/computedfield.md) on Circuit objects, using the Netutils `bits_to_name` function, to display the "Commit Rate" as a human-readable value by using the template code `{{ (obj.commit_rate * 1000) | bits_to_name }}`. (This particular example is contrived, as the Nautobot UI already humanizes the raw `commit_rate` value for display, but it demonstrates the kinds of things that these filters can be used for.)

In general the syntax for using a netutils filter in a Jinja2 template is something like `{{ arg1 | function_name }}` for functions that take a single argument, and `{{ arg1 | function_name(arg_name2=arg2, arg_name3=arg3) }}` for functions that take multiple arguments.

+++ 1.5.11
    Netutils functions are also available in Django templates after using the `{% load netutils %}` directive in a template. The syntax to use these functions is then generally `{% function_name arg_name1=arg1 arg_name2=arg2 %}`.

## Nautobot Built-In Filters

The Nautobot project also provides the following built-in `filters` that can be used in both Jinja2 and Django Template.

### as_range

Given a list of *n* items, return a corresponding range of *n* integers.

```django
# Django template
{% for i in record.parents|as_range %}
    <i class="mdi mdi-circle-small"></i>
{% endfor %}
```

### bettertitle

Alternative to the built-in `title` filter; capitalizes words without replacing letters that are already uppercase.

For example, `title("IP address") == "Ip Address"`, while `bettertitle("IP address") == "IP Address"`.

```django
{{ obj_type.name|bettertitle }}
```

### divide

Return x/y (rounded).

```django
# Django Template
{{ powerfeed.available_power|divide:3 }}VA

# Jinja
{{ powerfeed.available_power|divide(3) }}
```

### fgcolor

Return the ideal foreground color (black `"#000000"` or white `"#ffffff"`) given an arbitrary background color in RRGGBB format.

```django
color: {{ object.status.color|fgcolor }}
```

### get_docs_url

Return the static URL of the documentation for the specified model.

```django
{{ obj | get_docs_url }}
```

### get_item

Access a specific item/key in a dictionary.

```django
# Django Template
{{ labels|get_item:key }}

# Jinja
{{ labels|get_item(key) }}
```

### has_one_or_more_perms

Return True if the user has *at least one* of the permissions in the list.

```django
# Django Template
{{ request.user|has_one_or_more_perms:panel_details.permissions }}

# Jinja
{{ request.user|has_one_or_more_perms(panel_details.permissions) }}
```

### has_perms

Return True if the user has *all* permissions in the list.

```django
# Django Template
{{ request.user|has_perms:group_item_details.permissions }}

# Jinja
{{ request.user|has_perms(group_item_details.permissions) }}
```

### humanize_speed

Humanize speeds given in Kbps.
    1544 => "1.544 Mbps"
    100000 => "100 Mbps"
    10000000 => "10 Gbps"

```django
{{ speed_value | humanize_speed }}
```

### hyperlinked_object

+++ 1.4.0

Render and link to a Django model instance, if any, or render a placeholder if not.

Uses `object.display` if available, otherwise uses the string representation of the object.
If the object defines `get_absolute_url()` this will be used to hyperlink the displayed object;
additionally if there is an `object.description` this will be used as the title of the hyperlink.

```django
{{ device|hyperlinked_object }}
```

+++ 1.5.0
    This filter now accepts an optional `field` parameter, which allows you to use a field other than `object.display` for the object representation if desired. For example, to display the object's `name` field instead:

    ```django
    # Django Template
    {{ location|hyperlinked_object:"name" }}

    # Jinja
    {{ location|hyperlinked_object("name") }}
    ```

### meta

Return the specified Meta attribute of a model.

```django
{{ obj | meta('app_label') }}
```

### meters_to_feet

Convert a length from meters to feet.

```django
{{ meter_value | meters_to_feet }}
```

### percentage

Return x/y as a percentage.

```django
# Django Template
{{ powerfeed.available_power|percentage:total_power }}VA

# Jinja
{{ powerfeed.available_power|percentage(total_power) }}
```

### placeholder

Render a muted placeholder (`<span class="text-muted">&mdash;</span>`) if value is falsey, else render the provided value.

```django
{{ html | placeholder }}
```

### render_boolean

Render HTML from a computed boolean value.

If value is (for example) a non-empty string or True or a non-zero number, this renders `<span class="text-success"><i class="mdi mdi-check-bold" title="Yes"></i></span>`

If value is (for example) "" or 0 or False, this renders `<span class="text-danger"><i class="mdi mdi-close-thick" title="No"></i></span>`

If value is None this renders `<span class="text-muted">&mdash;</span>`

```django
{{ value | render_boolean }}
```

### render_json

Render a dictionary as formatted JSON.

```django
{{ data | render_json }}
```

### render_markdown

Render text as Markdown.

```django
{{ text | render_markdown }}
```

### render_yaml

Render a dictionary as formatted YAML.

```django
{{ data | render_yaml }}
```

### settings_or_config

Get a value from Django settings (if specified) or Constance configuration (otherwise).

```django
{{ "RELEASE_CHECK_URL" | settings_or_config }}
```

### split

Split a string by the given value (default: comma)

```django
# Django Template
{{ string | split }}
{{ string | split:';' }}

# Jinja
{{ string | split }}
{{ string | split(';') }}
```

### tzoffset

Returns the hour offset of a given time zone using the current time.

```django
{{ object.time_zone|tzoffset }}
```

### validated_viewname

Return the view name for the given model and action if valid, or None if invalid.

```django
# Django Template
{{ obj | validated_viewname:'list' }}

# Jinja
{{ obj | validated_viewname('list') }}
```

### viewname

Return the view name for the given model and action. Does not perform any validation.

```django
# Django Template
{{ obj | viewname:'list' }}

# Jinja
{{ obj | viewname('list') }}
```

# Note

+++ 1.4.0

Notes provide a place for you to store notes or general information on an object, such as a Device, that may not require a specific field for. This could be a note on a recent upgrade, a warning about a problematic device, or the reason the Rack was marked with the Status `Retired`.

The note field supports [Markdown Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/#basic-syntax).

# Optional Configuration Settings

## Administratively Configurable Settings

+++ 1.2.0

A number of settings can alternatively be configured via the Nautobot Admin UI. To do so, these settings must **not** be defined in your `nautobot_config.py`, as any settings defined there will take precedence over any values defined in the Admin UI. Settings that are currently configurable via the Admin UI include:

* [BANNER_BOTTOM](#banner_bottom)
* [BANNER_LOGIN](#banner_login)
* [BANNER_TOP](#banner_top)
* [CHANGELOG_RETENTION](#changelog_retention)
* [DEPLOYMENT_ID](#deployment_id)
* [DYNAMIC_GROUPS_MEMBER_CACHE_TIMEOUT](#dynamic_groups_member_cache_timeout)
* [HIDE_RESTRICTED_UI](#hide_restricted_ui)
* [MAX_PAGE_SIZE](#max_page_size)
* [NETWORK_DRIVERS](#network_drivers)
* [PAGINATE_COUNT](#paginate_count)
* [PER_PAGE_DEFAULTS](#per_page_defaults)
* [PREFER_IPV4](#prefer_ipv4)
* [RACK_ELEVATION_DEFAULT_UNIT_HEIGHT](#rack_elevation_default_unit_height)
* [RACK_ELEVATION_DEFAULT_UNIT_WIDTH](#rack_elevation_default_unit_width)
* [RELEASE_CHECK_TIMEOUT](#release_check_timeout)
* [RELEASE_CHECK_URL](#release_check_url)
* [SUPPORT_MESSAGE](#support_message)

## Extra Applications

A need may arise to allow the user to register additional settings. These will automatically apply
based on keynames prefixed with `EXTRA_` assuming the base key (the latter part of the setting name) is
of type list or tuple.

For example, to register additional `INSTALLED_APPS`, you would simply specify this in your custom
(user) configuration::

```python
EXTRA_INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'foo.bar',
]
```

This will ensure your default setting's `INSTALLED_APPS` do not have to be modified, and the user
can specify additional apps with ease.  Similarly, additional `MIDDLEWARE` can be added using `EXTRA_MIDDLEWARE`.

## ALLOWED_URL_SCHEMES

Default: `('file', 'ftp', 'ftps', 'http', 'https', 'irc', 'mailto', 'sftp', 'ssh', 'tel', 'telnet', 'tftp', 'vnc', 'xmpp')`

A list of permitted URL schemes referenced when rendering links within Nautobot. Note that only the schemes specified in this list will be accepted: If adding your own, be sure to replicate all of the default values as well (excluding those schemes which are not desirable).

---

## BANNER_TOP

## BANNER_BOTTOM

Default: `""` (Empty string)

Setting these variables will display custom content in a banner at the top and/or bottom of the page, respectively. HTML is allowed. To replicate the content of the top banner in the bottom banner, set:

```python
BANNER_TOP = 'Your banner text'
BANNER_BOTTOM = BANNER_TOP
```

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for these settings in your `nautobot_config.py`, they can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for either setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## BANNER_LOGIN

Default: `""` (Empty string)

This defines custom content to be displayed on the login page above the login form. HTML is allowed.

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## BRANDING_FILEPATHS

Default:

```python
{
    "logo": os.getenv("NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_LOGO", None),  # Navbar logo
    "favicon": os.getenv("NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_FAVICON", None),  # Browser favicon
    "icon_16": os.getenv("NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_ICON_16", None),  # 16x16px icon
    "icon_32": os.getenv("NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_ICON_32", None),  # 32x32px icon
    "icon_180": os.getenv("NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_ICON_180", None),  # 180x180px icon - used for the apple-touch-icon header
    "icon_192": os.getenv("NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_ICON_192", None),  # 192x192px icon
    "icon_mask": os.getenv("NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_ICON_MASK", None),  # mono-chrome icon used for the mask-icon header
}
```

A set of filepaths relative to the [`MEDIA_ROOT`](#media_root) which locate image assets used for custom branding. Each of these assets takes the place of the corresponding stock Nautobot asset. This allows for instance, providing your own navbar logo and favicon.

These environment variables may be used to specify the values:

* `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_LOGO`
* `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_FAVICON`
* `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_ICON_16`
* `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_ICON_32`
* `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_ICON_180`
* `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_ICON_192`
* `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_FILEPATHS_ICON_MASK`

If a custom image asset is not provided for any of the above options, the stock Nautobot asset is used.

---

## BRANDING_PREPENDED_FILENAME

+++ 1.3.4

Default: `"nautobot_"`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_PREPENDED_FILENAME`

Defines the prefix of the filename when exporting to CSV/YAML or export templates.

---

## BRANDING_TITLE

Default: `"Nautobot"`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_TITLE`

The defines the custom branding title that should be used in place of "Nautobot" within user facing areas of the application like the HTML title of web pages.

---

## BRANDING_URLS

Default:

```python
{
    "code": os.getenv("NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_URLS_CODE", "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot"),  # Code link in the footer
    "docs": os.getenv("NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_URLS_DOCS", "<STATIC_URL>docs/index.html"),  # Docs link in the footer
    "help": os.getenv("NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_URLS_HELP", "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/wiki"),  # Help link in the footer
}
```

A set of URLs that correspond to helpful links in the right of the footer on every web page.

These environment variables may be used to specify the values:

* `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_URLS_CODE`
* `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_URLS_DOCS`
* `NAUTOBOT_BRANDING_URLS_HELP`

If a custom URL is not provided for any of the links, the default link within the Nautobot community is used.

---

## CACHEOPS_DEFAULTS

Default: `{'timeout': 900}` (15 minutes, in seconds)

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_CACHEOPS_TIMEOUT` (timeout value only)

!!! warning
    It is an error to set the timeout value to `0`. If you wish to disable caching, please use [`CACHEOPS_ENABLED`](#cacheops_enabled).

Various defaults for caching, the most important of which being the cache timeout. The `timeout` is the number of seconds that cache entries will be retained before expiring.

---

## CACHEOPS_ENABLED

Default: `False`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_CACHEOPS_ENABLED`

A boolean that turns on/off caching.

!!! check "Changed in 1.5.0"
    Cachopes is disabled by default and will be removed entirely in a future release.

If set to `False`, all caching is bypassed and Nautobot operates as if there is no cache.

---

## CACHEOPS_HEALTH_CHECK_ENABLED

Default: `False`

A boolean that turns on/off health checks for the Redis server connection utilized by Cacheops. Most deployments share a Redis server with `django-redis` as such we only need to check the health of Redis one time.  If you are using a separate Redis deployment for Cacheops, please consider enabling this to monitor that Redis deployment.  Keep in mind the more health checks enabled the longer the health checks will take and timeouts might need to be increased.

---

## CELERY_BROKER_TRANSPORT_OPTIONS

Default: `{}`

A dict of additional options passed to the Celery broker transport. This is only required when [configuring Celery to utilize Redis Sentinel](../additional-features/caching.md#celery-sentinel-configuration).

---

## CELERY_BROKER_URL

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_CELERY_BROKER_URL`

Default: `'redis://localhost:6379/0'`

Celery broker URL used to tell workers where queues are located.

---

## CELERY_TASK_DEFAULT_QUEUE

+++ 1.5.0

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_CELERY_TASK_DEFAULT_QUEUE`

Default: `'default'`

The default celery queue name that will be used by workers if no queue is specified in the `nautobot-server celery worker` command. This queue will also be used by celery tasks if no queue is specified when a task is run.

---

## CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND`

Default: `'redis://localhost:6379/0'`

Celery result backend used to tell workers where to store task results (tombstones).

---

## CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND_TRANSPORT_OPTIONS

Default: `{}`

A dict of additional options passed to the Celery result backend transport. This is only required when [configuring Celery to utilize Redis Sentinel](../additional-features/caching.md#celery-sentinel-configuration).

---

## CELERY_TASK_SOFT_TIME_LIMIT

Default: `300` (5 minutes)

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_CELERY_TASK_SOFT_TIME_LIMIT`

The global Celery task soft timeout (in seconds). Any background task that exceeds this duration will receive a `SoftTimeLimitExceeded` exception and is responsible for handling this exception and performing any necessary cleanup or final operations before ending. See also `CELERY_TASK_TIME_LIMIT` below.

---

## CELERY_TASK_TIME_LIMIT

Default: `600` (10 minutes)

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_CELERY_TASK_TIME_LIMIT`

The global Celery task hard timeout (in seconds). Any background task that exceeds this duration will be forcibly killed with a `SIGKILL` signal.

---

## CELERY_WORKER_PROMETHEUS_PORTS

+++ 1.5.10

Default: `[]` (disabled)

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_CELERY_WORKER_PROMETHEUS_PORTS`

Ports for Prometheus metric HTTP server running on the celery worker(s).

Normally this should be set to a single port, unless you have multiple workers running on a single machine, i.e.
sharing the same available ports. In that case you need to specify a range of ports greater than or equal to the
highest amount of workers you are running on a single machine (comma-separated, like "8080,8081,8082"). You can then use
the `target_limit` parameter to the Prometheus `scrape_config` to ensure you are not getting duplicate metrics in that
case. Set this to an empty list to disable it.

---

## CHANGELOG_RETENTION

Default: `90`

The number of days to retain logged changes (object creations, updates, and deletions). Set this to `0` to retain changes in the database indefinitely.

!!! warning
    If enabling indefinite changelog retention, it is recommended to periodically delete old entries. Otherwise, the database may eventually exceed capacity.

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## CONFIG_CONTEXT_DYNAMIC_GROUPS_ENALBED

Default: `False`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_CONFIG_CONTEXT_DYNAMIC_GROUPS_ENABLED`

If `True`, it will be possible to apply Config Context objects to Devices and Virtual Machines via Dynamic Group membership. When set to `False` this behavior will not be available.

!!! warning
    With a large number of dynamic groups, enabling this could invoke a performance penalty when processing Config Contexts.

---

## CONTENT_TYPE_CACHE_TIMEOUT

+++ 1.6.0

Default: `0` (disabled)

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_CONTENT_TYPE_CACHE_TIMEOUT`

The number of seconds to cache the content type accessible via a object's class property `Object._content_type_cached`. This can save frequent calls to `ContentType.objects.get_for_model(model)`. Set this to `0` to disable caching.

---

## CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS

Default: `False`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS`

If `True`, all origins will be allowed. Other settings restricting allowed origins will be ignored.

Setting this to `True` can be dangerous, as it allows any website to make cross-origin requests to yours. Generally you'll want to restrict the list of allowed origins with [`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`](#cors_allowed_origins) or [`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEXES`](#cors_allowed_origin_regexes).

Previously this setting was called `CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL`, which still works as an alias, with the new name taking precedence.

---

## CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS

Default: `[]` (Empty list)

A list of origins that are authorized to make cross-site HTTP requests.

An Origin is defined by [the CORS RFC Section 3.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454#section-3.2) as a URI `scheme + hostname + port`, or one of the special values `'null'` or `'file://'`. Default ports (HTTPS = 443, HTTP = 80) are optional here.

The special value `null` is sent by the browser in ["privacy-sensitive contexts"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454#section-6), such as when the client is running from a `file://` domain. The special value `file://` is sent accidentally by some versions of Chrome on Android as per this bug.

Example:

```python
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
    "https://example.com",
    "https://sub.example.com",
    "http://localhost:8080",
    "http://127.0.0.1:9000"
]
```

Previously this setting was called `CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST`, which still works as an alias, with the new name taking precedence.

---

## CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEXES

Default: `[]`

A list of strings representing regexes that match Origins that are authorized to make cross-site HTTP requests. Useful when [`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`](#cors_allowed_origins) is impractical, such as when you have a large number of subdomains.

Example:

```python
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEXES = [
    r"^https://\w+\.example\.com$",
]
```

Previously this setting was called `CORS_ORIGIN_REGEX_WHITELIST`, which still works as an alias, with the new name taking precedence.

---

## DEPLOYMENT_ID

+++ 1.6.0

Default: a random UUID generated at install time.

This setting is used to uniquely but anonymously identify Nautobot deployments when sending installation metrics. This setting is not generally intended to be user-serviceable. See the documentation for the [`send_installation_metrics`](../administration/nautobot-server.md#send_installation_metrics) management command for more details.

## DISABLE_PREFIX_LIST_HIERARCHY

Default: `False`

This setting disables rendering of the IP prefix hierarchy (parent/child relationships) in the IPAM prefix list view. With large sets of prefixes, users may encounter a performance penalty when trying to load the prefix list view due to the nature of calculating the parent/child relationships. This setting allows users to disable the hierarchy and instead only render a flat list of all prefixes in the table.

A later release of Nautobot will address the underlying performance issues, and likely remove this configuration option.

---

## DYNAMIC_GROUPS_MEMBER_CACHE_TIMEOUT

+++ 1.6.0

Default: `0` (disabled)

The number of seconds to cache the member list of dynamic groups. With large datasets (those in scope of a Dynamic Group and number of Dynamic Groups themselves), users will encounter a performance penalty using or accessing the membership lists. This setting allows users to accept a cached list for common use cases (particularly in the UI) that expires after the configured time. Set this to `0` to disable caching.

---

## ENFORCE_GLOBAL_UNIQUE

Default: `False`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_ENFORCE_GLOBAL_UNIQUE`

By default, Nautobot will permit users to create duplicate prefixes and IP addresses in the global table (that is, those which are not assigned to any VRF). This behavior can be disabled by setting `ENFORCE_GLOBAL_UNIQUE` to `True`.

---

## EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS

Default: `[]` (Empty list)

A list of Nautobot models to exempt from the enforcement of view permissions. Models listed here will be viewable by all users, both authenticated and anonymous.

List models in the form `<app>.<model>`. For example:

```python
EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS = [
    'dcim.site',
    'dcim.region',
    'ipam.prefix',
]
```

To exempt _all_ models from view permission enforcement, set the following. (Note that `EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS` must be an iterable.)

```python
EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS = ['*']
```

!!! note
    Using a wildcard will not affect certain potentially sensitive models, such as user permissions. If there is a need to exempt these models, they must be specified individually.

---

## EXTERNAL_AUTH_DEFAULT_GROUPS

Default: `[]` (Empty list)

The list of group names to assign a new user account when created using 3rd-party authentication.

---

## EXTERNAL_AUTH_DEFAULT_PERMISSIONS

Default: `{}` (Empty dictionary)

A mapping of permissions to assign a new user account when created using SSO authentication. Each key in the dictionary will be the permission name specified as `<app_label>.<action>_<model>`, and the value should be set to the permission [constraints](../administration/permissions.md#constraints), or `None` to allow all objects.

### Example Permissions

| Permission | Description |
|---|---|
| `{'dcim.view_device': {}}` or `{'dcim.view_device': None}` | Users can view all devices |
| `{'dcim.add_device': {}}` | Users can add devices, see note below |
| `{'dcim.view_device': {"site__name__in":  ["HQ"]}}` | Users can view all devices in the HQ site |

!!! warning
    Permissions can be complicated! Be careful when restricting permissions to also add any required prerequisite permissions.

    For example, when adding Devices the Device Role, Device Type, Site, and Status fields are all required fields in order for the UI to function properly. Users will also need view permissions for those fields or the corresponding field selections in the UI will be unavailable and potentially prevent objects from being able to be created or edited.

The following example gives a user a reasonable amount of access to add devices to a single site (HQ in this case):

```python
{
    'dcim.add_device': {"site__name__in":  ["HQ"]},
    'dcim.view_device': {"site__name__in":  ["HQ"]},
    'dcim.view_devicerole': None,
    'dcim.view_devicetype': None,
    'extras.view_status': None,
    'dcim.view_site': {"name__in":  ["HQ"]},
    'dcim.view_manufacturer': None,
    'dcim.view_region': None,
    'dcim.view_rack': None,
    'dcim.view_rackgroup': None,
    'dcim.view_platform': None,
    'virtualization.view_cluster': None,
    'virtualization.view_clustergroup': None,
    'tenancy.view_tenant': None,
    'tenancy.view_tenantgroup': None,
}
```

Please see [the object permissions page](../administration/permissions.md) for more information.

---

## GIT_ROOT

Default: `os.path.join(NAUTOBOT_ROOT, "git")`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_GIT_ROOT`

The file path to a directory where cloned [Git repositories](../models/extras/gitrepository.md) will be located.

The value of this variable can also be customized by setting the environment variable `NAUTOBOT_GIT_ROOT` to a directory path of your choosing.

---

## GRAPHQL_COMPUTED_FIELD_PREFIX

Default: `"cpf"`

By default, all computed fields in GraphQL will be prefixed with `cf`. A computed field named `my_field` will appear in GraphQL as `cpf_my_field` by default. It's possible to change or remove the prefix by setting the value of `GRAPHQL_COMPUTED_FIELD_PREFIX`.

---

## GRAPHQL_CUSTOM_FIELD_PREFIX

Default: `"cf"`

By default, all custom fields in GraphQL will be prefixed with `cf`. A custom field named `my_field` will appear in GraphQL as `cf_my_field` by default. It's possible to change or remove the prefix by setting the value of `GRAPHQL_CUSTOM_FIELD_PREFIX`.

---

## GRAPHQL_RELATIONSHIP_PREFIX

Default: `"rel"`

By default, all relationship associations in GraphQL will be prefixed with `rel`. A relationship named `my_relationship` will appear in GraphQL as `rel_my_relationship` by default. It's possible to change or remove the prefix by setting the value of `GRAPHQL_RELATIONSHIP_PREFIX`.

---

## HIDE_RESTRICTED_UI

Default: `False`

When set to `True`, users with limited permissions will only be able to see items in the UI they have access to.

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

+++ 1.3.10
    When this setting is set to `True`, logged out users will be redirected to the login page when navigating to the Nautobot home page.

---

## HTTP_PROXIES

Default: `None` (Disabled)

A dictionary of HTTP proxies to use for outbound requests originating from Nautobot (e.g. when sending webhook requests). Proxies should be specified by schema (HTTP and HTTPS) as per the [Python requests library documentation](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/). For example:

```python
HTTP_PROXIES = {
    'http': 'http://10.10.1.10:3128',
    'https': 'http://10.10.1.10:1080',
}
```

!!! note
    When using Git repositories within Nautobot the Python library `GitPython` needs extra proxy configuration:

```bash
git config --global http.proxy http://192.0.2.1:3128
git config --global https.proxy http://192.0.2.1:3128
```

---

## INSTALLATION_METRICS_ENABLED

+++ 1.6.0

Default: `True` for existing Nautobot deployments, user-specified when running `nautobot-server init` for a new deployment.

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_INSTALLATION_METRICS_ENABLED`

When set to `True`, Nautobot will send anonymized installation metrics to the Nautobot maintainers when running the [`post_upgrade`](../administration/nautobot-server.md#post_upgrade) or [`send_installation_metrics`](../administration/nautobot-server.md#send_installation_metrics) management commands. See the documentation for the [`send_installation_metrics`](../administration/nautobot-server.md#send_installation_metrics) management command for more details.

## JOBS_ROOT

Default: `os.path.join(NAUTOBOT_ROOT, "jobs")`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_JOBS_ROOT`

The file path to a directory where [Jobs](../additional-features/jobs.md) can be discovered.

!!! caution
    This directory **must** contain an `__init__.py` file.

---

## LOG_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS

--- 1.5.3
    This setting was moved to [environment variable only](#nautobot_log_deprecation_warnings) as it conflicts with app startup due to import-time order.

---

## MAINTENANCE_MODE

Default: `False`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_MAINTENANCE_MODE`

Setting this to `True` will display a "maintenance mode" banner at the top of every page. Additionally, Nautobot will no longer update a user's "last active" time upon login. This is to allow new logins when the database is in a read-only state. Recording of login times will resume when maintenance mode is disabled.

!!! note
    The default [`SESSION_ENGINE`](#session_engine) configuration will store sessions in the database, this obviously will not work when `MAINTENANCE_MODE` is `True` and the database is in a read-only state for maintenance.  Consider setting `SESSION_ENGINE` to `django.contrib.sessions.backends.cache` when enabling `MAINTENANCE_MODE`.

!!! note
    The Docker container normally attempts to run migrations on startup; however, if the database is in a read-only state the Docker container will fail to start.  Setting the environment variable [`NAUTOBOT_DOCKER_SKIP_INIT`](../docker/index.md#nautobot_docker_skip_init) to `true` will prevent the migrations from occurring.

!!! note
    If you are using `django-auth-ldap` for LDAP authentication, `django-auth-ldap` by default will try to update a user object on every log in.  If the database is in a read-only state `django-auth-ldap` will fail.  You will also need to set `AUTH_LDAP_ALWAYS_UPDATE_USER=False` and `AUTH_LDAP_NO_NEW_USERS=True` to avoid this, please see the [`django-auth-ldap` documentation](https://django-auth-ldap.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference.html) for more information.

---

## MAX_PAGE_SIZE

Default: `1000`

A web user or API consumer can request an arbitrary number of objects by appending the "limit" parameter to the URL (e.g. `?limit=1000`). This parameter defines the maximum acceptable limit. Setting this to `0` or `None` will allow a client to retrieve _all_ matching objects at once with no limit by specifying `?limit=0`.

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## METRICS_ENABLED

Default: `False`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_METRICS_ENABLED`

Toggle the availability Prometheus-compatible metrics at `/metrics`. See the [Prometheus Metrics](../additional-features/prometheus-metrics.md) documentation for more details.

---

## NAPALM_USERNAME

## NAPALM_PASSWORD

Default: `""` (Empty string)

Environment Variables: `NAUTOBOT_NAPALM_USERNAME` and `NAUTOBOT_NAPALM_PASSWORD`

Nautobot will use these credentials when authenticating to remote devices via the [NAPALM library](https://napalm.readthedocs.io), if installed. Both parameters are optional.

!!! note
    If SSH public key authentication has been set up on the remote device(s) for the system account under which Nautobot runs, these parameters are not needed.

!!! note
    If a given device has an appropriately populated [secrets group](../models/extras/secretsgroup.md) assigned to it, the [secrets](../models/extras/secret.md) defined in that group will take precedence over these default values.

---

## NAPALM_ARGS

Default: `{}` (Empty dictionary)

A dictionary of optional arguments to pass to NAPALM when instantiating a network driver. See the NAPALM documentation for a [complete list of optional arguments](https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/support/#optional-arguments). An example:

```python
NAPALM_ARGS = {
    'api_key': '472071a93b60a1bd1fafb401d9f8ef41',
    'port': 2222,
}
```

Some platforms (e.g. Cisco IOS) require an enable password to be passed in addition to the normal password. If desired, you can use the configured `NAPALM_PASSWORD` as the value for this argument:

```python
NAPALM_USERNAME = 'username'
NAPALM_PASSWORD = 'MySecretPassword'
NAPALM_ARGS = {
    'secret': NAPALM_PASSWORD,          # ios and nxos_ssh
    'enable_password': NAPALM_PASSWORD, # eos
    # Include any additional args here
}
```

!!! note
    If a given device has an appropriately populated [secrets group](../models/extras/secretsgroup.md) assigned to it, a [secret](../models/extras/secret.md) defined in that group can override the `NAPALM_ARGS["secret"]` or `NAPALM_ARGS["enable_password"]` default value defined here.

---

## NAPALM_TIMEOUT

Default: `30`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_NAPALM_TIMEOUT`

The amount of time (in seconds) to wait for NAPALM to connect to a device.

---

## NETWORK_DRIVERS

+++ 1.6.0

Default: `{}` (Empty dictionary)

An optional dictionary to extend or override the default `Platform.network_driver` translations provided by [netutils](https://netutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/lib_use_cases_lib_mapper/). For example, to add support for a custom `Platform.network_driver` value of `"my_network_driver"` for Netmiko and PyATS drivers:

```python
NETWORK_DRIVERS = {
    "netmiko": {"my_network_driver": "cisco_ios"},
    "pyats": {"my_network_driver": "iosxe"},
}
```

The default top-level keys are `ansible`, `hier_config`, `napalm`, `netmiko`, `ntc_templates`, `pyats`, `pyntc`, and `scrapli`, but you can also add additional keys if you have an alternative network driver that you want your Nautobot instance to include.

!!! tip
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## PAGINATE_COUNT

Default: `50`

The default maximum number of objects to display per page within each list of objects. Applies to both the UI and the REST API.

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## PER_PAGE_DEFAULTS

Default: `[25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000]`

The options displayed in the web interface dropdown to limit the number of objects per page. For proper user experience, this list should include the [`PAGINATE_COUNT`](#paginate_count) and [`MAX_PAGE_SIZE`](#max_page_size) values as options.

---

## PLUGINS

Default: `[]` (Empty list)

A list of installed [Nautobot plugins](../plugins/index.md) to enable. Plugins will not take effect unless they are listed here.

!!! warning
    Plugins extend Nautobot by allowing external code to run with the same access and privileges as Nautobot itself. Only install plugins from trusted sources. The Nautobot maintainers make absolutely no guarantees about the integrity or security of your installation with plugins enabled.

---

## PLUGINS_CONFIG

Default: `{}` (Empty dictionary)

This parameter holds configuration settings for individual Nautobot plugins. It is defined as a dictionary, with each key using the name of an installed plugin. The specific parameters supported are unique to each plugin: Reference the plugin's documentation to determine the supported parameters. An example configuration is shown below:

```python
PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    'plugin1': {
        'foo': 123,
        'bar': True
    },
    'plugin2': {
        'foo': 456,
    },
}
```

Note that a plugin must be listed in `PLUGINS` for its configuration to take effect.

---

## PREFER_IPV4

Default: `False`

When determining the primary IP address for a device, IPv6 is preferred over IPv4 by default. Set this to True to prefer IPv4 instead.

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## RACK_ELEVATION_DEFAULT_UNIT_HEIGHT

Default: `22`

Default height (in pixels) of a unit within a rack elevation. For best results, this should be approximately one tenth of `RACK_ELEVATION_DEFAULT_UNIT_WIDTH`.

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## RACK_ELEVATION_DEFAULT_UNIT_WIDTH

Default: `220`

Default width (in pixels) of a unit within a rack elevation.

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## REDIS_LOCK_TIMEOUT

Default: `600`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_REDIS_LOCK_TIMEOUT`

Maximum duration of a Redis lock created when calling `/api/ipam/prefixes/{id}/available-prefixes/` or `/api/ipam/prefixes/{id}/available-ips/` to avoid inadvertently allocating the same prefix or IP to multiple simultaneous callers. Default is set to 600 seconds (10 minutes) to be longer than any theoretical API call time. This is to prevent a deadlock scenario where the server did not gracefully exit the `with` block when acquiring the Redis lock.

---

## RELEASE_CHECK_TIMEOUT

Default: `86400` (24 hours)

The number of seconds to retain the latest version that is fetched from the GitHub API before automatically invalidating it and fetching it from the API again.

!!! warning
    This must be set to at least one hour (`3600` seconds). Setting it to a value lower than this is an error.

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## RELEASE_CHECK_URL

Default: `None` (disabled)

This parameter defines the URL of the repository that will be checked periodically for new Nautobot releases. When a new release is detected, a message will be displayed to administrative users on the home page. This can be set to the official repository (`'https://api.github.com/repos/nautobot/nautobot/releases'`) or a custom fork. Set this to `None` to disable automatic update checks.

!!! note
    The URL provided **must** be compatible with the [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest).

+++ 1.2.0
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## SANITIZER_PATTERNS

+++ 1.3.4

Default:

```python
[
    (re.compile(r"(https?://)?\S+\s*@", re.IGNORECASE), r"\1{replacement}@"),
    (re.compile(r"(username|password|passwd|pwd)((?:\s+is.?|:)?\s+)\S+", re.IGNORECASE), r"\1\2{replacement}"),
]
```

List of (regular expression, replacement pattern) tuples used by the `nautobot.utilities.logging.sanitize()` function. As of Nautobot 1.3.4 this function is used primarily for sanitization of Job log entries, but it may be used in other scopes in the future.

---

## STORAGE_BACKEND

Default: `None` (local storage)

The backend storage engine for handling uploaded files (e.g. image attachments). Nautobot supports integration with the [`django-storages`](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package, which provides backends for several popular file storage services. If not configured, local filesystem storage will be used.

An example of using django-storages with AWS S3 buckets, visit the [django-storages with S3](../user-guides/s3-django-storage.md) user-guide.

The configuration parameters for the specified storage backend are defined under the [`STORAGE_CONFIG`](#storage_config) setting.

---

## STORAGE_CONFIG

Default: `{}` (Empty dictionary)

A dictionary of configuration parameters for the storage backend configured as [`STORAGE_BACKEND`](#storage_backend). The specific parameters to be used here are specific to each backend; see the [`django-storages` documentation](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for more detail.

If [`STORAGE_BACKEND`](#storage_backend) is not defined, this setting will be ignored.

---

## STRICT_FILTERING

+++ 1.4.0

Default: `True`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_STRICT_FILTERING`

If set to `True` (default), UI and REST API filtering of object lists will fail if an unknown/unrecognized filter parameter is provided as a URL parameter. (For example, `/dcim/devices/?ice_cream_flavor=chocolate` or `/api/dcim/sites/?ice_cream_flavor=chocolate`). UI list (table) views will report an error message in this case and display no filtered objects; REST API list endpoints will return a 400 Bad Request response with an explanatory error message.

If set to `False`, unknown/unrecognized filter parameters will be discarded and ignored, although Nautobot will log a warning message.

!!! warning
    Setting this to `False` can result in unexpected filtering results in the case of user error, for example `/dcim/devices/?has_primry_ip=false` (note the typo `primry`) will result in a list of all devices, rather than the intended list of only devices that lack a primary IP address. In the case of Jobs or external automation making use of such a filter, this could have wide-ranging consequences.

---

## SUPPORT_MESSAGE

+++ 1.6.4

Default: `""`

A message to include on error pages (status code 403, 404, 500, etc.) when an error occurs. You can configure this to direct users to the appropriate contact(s) within your organization that provide support for Nautobot. Markdown formatting is supported within this message, as well as [a limited subset of HTML](../additional-features/template-filters.md#render_markdown).

If unset, the default message that will appear is `If further assistance is required, please join the #nautobot channel on [Network to Code's Slack community](https://slack.networktocode.com) and post your question.`

!!! tip
    If you do not set a value for this setting in your `nautobot_config.py`, it can be configured dynamically by an admin user via the Nautobot Admin UI. If you do have a value for this setting in `nautobot_config.py`, it will override any dynamically configured value.

---

## TEST_FACTORY_SEED

+++ 1.5.0

Default: `None`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_TEST_FACTORY_SEED`

When [`TEST_USE_FACTORIES`](#test_use_factories) is set to `True`, this configuration provides a fixed seed string for the pseudo-random generator used to populate test data into the database, providing for reproducible randomness across consecutive test runs. If unset, a random seed will be used each time.

---

## TEST_USE_FACTORIES

+++ 1.5.0

Default: `False`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_TEST_USE_FACTORIES`

If set to `True`, the Nautobot test runner will call `nautobot-server generate_test_data ...` before executing any test cases, pre-populating the test database with various pseudo-random instances of many of Nautobot's data models.

!!! warning
    This functionality requires the installation of the [`factory-boy`](https://pypi.org/project/factory-boy/) Python package, which is present in Nautobot's own development environment, but is _not_ an inherent dependency of the Nautobot package when installed otherwise, such as into a plugin's development environment.

!!! info
    Setting this to `True` is a requirement for all Nautobot core tests as of 1.5.0, and it is set accordingly in `nautobot/core/tests/nautobot_config.py`, but defaults to `False` otherwise so as to remain backwards-compatible with plugins that also may use the Nautobot test runner in their own test environments, but have not yet updated their tests to account for the presence of this test data.

    Because this test data can obviate the need to manually construct complex test data, and the random factor can improve test robustness, plugin developers are encouraged to set this to `True` in their configuration, ensure that their development environments include the `factory-boy` Python package as a test dependency, and update their tests as needed.

---

## TEST_PERFORMANCE_BASELINE_FILE

+++ 1.5.0

Default: `nautobot/core/tests/performance_baselines.yml`

Environment Variable: `TEST_PERFORMANCE_BASELINE_FILE`

[`TEST_PERFORMANCE_BASELINE_FILE`](#test_performance_baseline_file) is set to a certain file path, this file path should point to a .yml file that conforms to the following format:

```yaml
tests:
  - name: >-
      test_run_job_with_sensitive_variables_and_requires_approval
      (nautobot.extras.tests.test_views.JobTestCase)
    execution_time: 4.799533
  - name: test_run_missing_schedule (nautobot.extras.tests.test_views.JobTestCase)
    execution_time: 4.367563
  - name: test_run_now_missing_args (nautobot.extras.tests.test_views.JobTestCase)
    execution_time: 4.363194
  - name: >-
      test_create_object_with_constrained_permission
      (nautobot.extras.tests.test_views.GraphQLQueriesTestCase)
    execution_time: 3.474244
  - name: >-
      test_run_now_constrained_permissions
      (nautobot.extras.tests.test_views.JobTestCase)
    execution_time: 2.727531
...
```

and store the performance baselines with the `name` of the test and the baseline `execution_time`. This file should provide the baseline times that all performance-related tests are running against.

---

## UI_RACK_VIEW_TRUNCATE_FUNCTION

+++ 1.4.0

Default:

```py
def UI_RACK_VIEW_TRUNCATE_FUNCTION(device_display_name):
    return str(device_display_name).split(".")[0]
```

This setting function is used to perform the rack elevation truncation feature. This provides a way to tailor the truncation behavior to best suit the needs of the installation.

The function must take only one argument: the device display name, as a string, attempting to be rendered on the rack elevation.

The function must return only one argument: a string of the truncated device display name.

## Environment-Variable-Only Settings

!!! warning
    The following settings are **only** configurable as environment variables, and not via `nautobot_config.py` or similar.

---

### GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY

Default: Unset

If you are using a self-signed git repository, you will need to set the environment variable `GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY="1"`
in order for the repository to sync.

!!! warning
    This _must_ be specified as an environment variable. Setting it in `nautobot_config.py` will not have the desired effect.

---

## NAUTOBOT_LOG_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS

+++ 1.5.2

+/- 1.5.3
    This was previously available as a config file setting but changed to environment-variable only. Also `DEBUG = True` will no longer work to log deprecation warnings.

Default: `False`

This can be set to `True` to allow deprecation warnings raised by Nautobot to (additionally) be logged as `WARNING` level log messages. (Deprecation warnings are normally silent in Python, but can be enabled globally by [various means](https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html) such as setting the `PYTHONWARNINGS` environment variable. However, doing so can be rather noisy, as it will also include warnings from within Django about various code in various package dependencies of Nautobot's, etc. This configuration setting allows a more targeted enablement of only warnings from within Nautobot itself, which can be useful when vetting various Nautobot apps (plugins) for future-proofness against upcoming changes to Nautobot.)

!!! caution
    In Nautobot 2.0, deprecation warnings will be logged by default; a future release of Nautobot 1.5.x will also enable default logging of deprecation warnings.

---

### NAUTOBOT_ROOT

Default: `~/.nautobot/`

The filesystem path to use to store Nautobot files (Jobs, uploaded images, Git repositories, etc.).

This setting is used internally in the core settings to provide default locations for [features that require file storage](index.md#file-storage), and the [default location of the `nautobot_config.py`](index.md#specifying-your-configuration).

!!! warning
    Do not override `NAUTOBOT_ROOT` in your `nautobot_config.py`. It will not work as expected. If you need to customize this setting, please always set the `NAUTOBOT_ROOT` environment variable.

## Django Configuration Settings

While the [official Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/) documents all Django settings, the below is provided where either the setting is common in Nautobot deployments and/or there is a supported `NAUTOBOT_*` environment variable.

### ADMINS

Default: `[]` (Empty list)

Nautobot will email details about critical errors to the administrators listed here. This should be a list of (name, email) tuples. For example:

```python
ADMINS = [
    ['Hank Hill', 'hhill@example.com'],
    ['Dale Gribble', 'dgribble@example.com'],
]
```

Please see the [official Django documentation on `ADMINS`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#admins) for more information.

---

### CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS

Default: `[]`

A list of hosts (fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs) or subdomains) that are considered trusted origins for cross-site secure requests such as HTTPS POST.

For more information, please see the [official Django documentation on `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#csrf-trusted-origins) and more generally the [official Django documentation on CSRF protection](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/csrf/#how-it-works)

---

### Date and Time Formatting

You may define custom formatting for date and times. For detailed instructions on writing format strings, please see [the Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/templates/builtins/#date). Default formats are listed below.

```python
DATE_FORMAT = 'N j, Y'               # June 26, 2016
SHORT_DATE_FORMAT = 'Y-m-d'          # 2016-06-26
TIME_FORMAT = 'g:i a'                # 1:23 p.m.
DATETIME_FORMAT = 'N j, Y g:i a'     # June 26, 2016 1:23 p.m.
SHORT_DATETIME_FORMAT = 'Y-m-d H:i'  # 2016-06-26 13:23
```

Environment Variables:

* `NAUTOBOT_DATE_FORMAT`
* `NAUTOBOT_SHORT_DATE_FORMAT`
* `NAUTOBOT_TIME_FORMAT`
* `NAUTOBOT_SHORT_TIME_FORMAT`
* `NAUTOBOT_DATETIME_FORMAT`
* `NAUTOBOT_SHORT_DATETIME_FORMAT`

---

### DEBUG

Default: `False`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_DEBUG`

This setting enables debugging. Debugging should be enabled only during development or troubleshooting. Note that only
clients which access Nautobot from a recognized [internal IP address](#internal_ips) will see debugging tools in the user interface.

!!! warning
    Never enable debugging on a production system, as it can expose sensitive data to unauthenticated users and impose a
    substantial performance penalty.

Please see the [official Django documentation on `DEBUG`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#debug) for more information.

---

### FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME

Default: `None`

If not `None`, this will be used as the value of the `SCRIPT_NAME` environment variable in any HTTP request. This setting can be used to override the server-provided value of `SCRIPT_NAME`, which is most commonly used for hosting Nautobot in a subdirectory (e.g. _example.com/nautobot/_).

!!! important
    To host Nautobot under a subdirectory you must set this value to match the same prefix configured on your HTTP server. For example, if you configure NGINX to serve Nautobot at `/nautobot/`, you must set `FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME = "/nautobot/"`.

Please see the [official Django documentation on `FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#force-script-name) for more information.

---

### INTERNAL_IPS

Default: `('127.0.0.1', '::1')`

A list of IP addresses recognized as internal to the system, used to control the display of debugging output. For
example, the [Django debugging toolbar](https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/), if installed,
will be viewable only when a client is accessing Nautobot from one of the listed IP
addresses (and [`DEBUG`](#debug) is true).

---

### LOGGING

Default:

```python
{
    "version": 1,
    "disable_existing_loggers": False,
    "formatters": {

            "handlers": ["verbose_console" if DEBUG else "normal_console"],
            "level": LOG_LEVEL,
        },
    },
}
```

+/- 1.4.10
    While running unit or integration tests via `nautobot-server test ...`, LOGGING will be set to `{}` instead of the above defaults, as verbose logging to the console is typically not desirable while running tests.

This translates to:

* all messages from Django and from Nautobot of INFO severity or higher will be logged to the console.
* if [`DEBUG`](#debug) is True, Nautobot DEBUG messages will also be logged, and all Nautobot messages will be logged with a more verbose format including the filename and function name that originated each log message.

The above default log formatters split each log message across two lines of output for greater readability, which is useful for local observation and troubleshooting, but you may find it impractical to use in production environments that expect one line per log message. Fortunately, the Django framework on which Nautobot runs allows for extensive customization of logging format and destination. Please consult the [Django logging documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/logging/) for more information on configuring this setting.

Below is an example configuration extension which will additionally write all INFO and higher messages to a local file:

```python
LOGGING["handlers"]["file"] = {
    "level": "INFO",
    "class": "logging.FileHandler",
    "filename": "/var/log/nautobot.log",
    "formatter": "normal",
}
LOGGING["loggers"]["django"]["handlers"] += ["file"]
LOGGING["loggers"]["nautobot"]["handlers"] += ["file"]
```

Additional examples are available in the [`/examples/logging`](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/tree/develop/examples/logging) directory in the Nautobot repository.

#### Available Loggers

* `django.*` - Generic Django operations (HTTP requests/responses, etc.)
* `nautobot.<app>.<module>` - Generic form for model- or module-specific log messages
* `nautobot.auth.*` - Authentication events
* `nautobot.jobs.*` - Job execution (`* = JobClassName`)
* `nautobot.graphql.*` - [GraphQL](../additional-features/graphql.md) initialization and operation.
* `nautobot.plugins.*` - Plugin loading and activity
* `nautobot.views.*` - Views which handle business logic for the web UI

---

### MEDIA_ROOT

Default: `os.path.join(NAUTOBOT_ROOT, "media")`

The file path to the location where media files (such as [image attachments](../models/extras/imageattachment.md)) are stored.

Please see the [official Django documentation on `MEDIA_ROOT`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#media-root) for more information.

---

### SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE

Default: `False`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE`

If this is set to True, Nautobot will use browser-length cookies - cookies that expire as soon as the user closes their browser.

By default, `SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE` is set to False, which means session cookies will be stored in users’ browsers for as long as [`SESSION_COOKIE_AGE`](#session_cookie_age).

Please see the [official Django documentation on `SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#session-expire-at-browser-close) for more information.

---

### SESSION_COOKIE_AGE

Default: `1209600` (2 weeks, in seconds)

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_SESSION_COOKIE_AGE`

The age of session cookies, in seconds.

Please see the [official Django documentation on `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#session-cookie-age) for more information.

---

### SESSION_ENGINE

Default: `'django.contrib.sessions.backends.db'`

Controls where Nautobot stores session data.

To use cache-based sessions, set this to `'django.contrib.sessions.backends.cache'`.
To use file-based sessions, set this to `'django.contrib.sessions.backends.file'`.

See the official Django documentation on [Configuring the session](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/http/sessions/#configuring-sessions) engine for more details.

---

### SESSION_FILE_PATH

Default: `None`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_SESSION_FILE_PATH`

HTTP session data is used to track authenticated users when they access Nautobot. By default, Nautobot stores session data in its database. However, this inhibits authentication to a standby instance of Nautobot without write access to the database. Alternatively, a local file path may be specified here and Nautobot will store session data as files instead of using the database. Note that the Nautobot system user must have read and write permissions to this path.

When the default value (`None`) is used, Nautobot will use the standard temporary directory for the system.

If you set this value, you must also enable file-based sessions as explained above using [`SESSION_ENGINE`](#session_engine).

---

### STATIC_ROOT

Default: `os.path.join(NAUTOBOT_ROOT, "static")`

The location where static files (such as CSS, JavaScript, fonts, or images) used to serve the web interface will be staged by the `nautobot-server collectstatic` command.

Please see the [official Django documentation on `STATIC_ROOT`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#std:setting-STATIC_ROOT) for more information.

---

### TIME_ZONE

Default: `"UTC"`

Environment Variable: `NAUTOBOT_TIME_ZONE`

The time zone Nautobot will use when dealing with dates and times. It is recommended to use UTC time unless you have a specific need to use a local time zone. Please see the [list of available time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

Please see the [official Django documentation on `TIME_ZONE`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#time-zone) for more information.



----- FILE: nautobot_docs_additional-features_jobs.md (NEW) -----
# Jobs

Jobs are a way for users to execute custom logic on demand from within the Nautobot UI. Jobs can interact directly with Nautobot data to accomplish various data creation, modification, and validation tasks, such as:

* Automatically populate new devices and cables in preparation for a new site deployment
* Create a range of new reserved prefixes or IP addresses
* Fetch data from an external source and import it to Nautobot
* Check and report whether all top-of-rack switches have a console connection
* Check and report whether every router has a loopback interface with an assigned IP address
* Check and report whether all IP addresses have a parent prefix

...and so on. Jobs are Python code and exist outside of the official Nautobot code base, so they can be updated and changed without interfering with the core Nautobot installation. And because they're completely customizable, there's practically no limit to what a job can accomplish.

!!! note
    Jobs unify and supersede the functionality previously provided in NetBox by "custom scripts" and "reports". Jobs are backwards-compatible for now with the `Script` and `Report` class APIs, but you are urged to move to the new `Job` class API described below. Jobs may be optionally marked as [read-only](#read_only) which equates to the `Report` functionally, but in all cases, user input is supported via [job variables](#variables).

## Writing Jobs

Jobs may be installed in one of three ways:

* Manually installed as files in the [`JOBS_ROOT`](../configuration/optional-settings.md#jobs_root) path (which defaults to `$NAUTOBOT_ROOT/jobs/`).
    * The `JOBS_ROOT` directory *must* contain a file named `__init__.py`. Do not delete this file.
    * Each file created within this path is considered a separate module; there is no support for cross-file dependencies (such as a file acting as a common "library" module of functions shared between jobs) for files installed in this way.
* Imported from an external [Git repository](../models/extras/gitrepository.md#jobs).
    * The repository's `jobs/` directory *must* contain a file named `__init__.py`.
    * Each Job file in the repository is considered a separate module; there is no support for cross-file dependencies (such as a file acting as a common "library" module of functions shared between jobs) for files installed in this way.
* Packaged as part of a [plugin](../plugins/development.md#including-jobs).
    * Jobs installed this way are part of the plugin module and can import code from elsewhere in the plugin or even have dependencies on other packages, if needed, via the standard Python packaging mechanisms.

In any case, each module holds one or more Jobs (Python classes), each of which serves a specific purpose. The logic of each job can be split into a number of distinct methods, each of which performs a discrete portion of the overall job logic.

For example, we can create a module named `devices.py` to hold all of our jobs which pertain to devices in Nautobot. Within that module, we might define several jobs. Each job is defined as a Python class inheriting from `extras.jobs.Job`, which provides the base functionality needed to accept user input and log activity.

!!! warning
    Make sure you are *not* inheriting `extras.jobs.models.Job` instead, otherwise Django will think you want to define a new database model.

```python
from nautobot.extras.jobs import Job

class CreateDevices(Job):
    ...

class DeviceConnectionsReport(Job):
    ...

class DeviceIPsReport(Job):
    ...
```

Each job class will implement some or all of the following components:

* Module and class attributes, providing for default behavior, documentation and discoverability
* a set of variables for user input via the Nautobot UI (if your job requires any user inputs)
* a `run()` method, which is executed first and receives the user input values, if any
* any number of `test_*()` methods, which will be invoked next in order of declaration. Log messages generated by the job will be grouped together by the test method they were invoked from.
* a `post_run()` method, which is executed last and can be used to handle any necessary cleanup or final events (such as sending an email or triggering a webhook). The status of the overall job is available at this time as `self.failed` and the `JobResult` data object is available as `self.result`.

You can implement the entire job within the `run()` function, but for more complex jobs, you may want to provide more granularity in the output and logging of activity. For this purpose, you can implement portions of the logic as `test_*()` methods (i.e., methods whose name begins with `test_*`) and/or a `post_run()` method. Log messages generated by the job logging APIs (more below on this topic) will be grouped together according to their base method (`run`, `test_a`, `test_b`, ..., `post_run`) which can aid in understanding the operation of the job.

!!! note
    Your job can of course define additional Python methods to compartmentalize and reuse logic as required; however the `run`, `test_*`, and `post_run` methods are the only ones that will be automatically invoked by Nautobot.

It's important to understand that jobs execute on the server asynchronously as background tasks; they log messages and report their status to the database by updating [`JobResult`](../models/extras/jobresult.md) records and creating [`JobLogEntry`](../models/extras/joblogentry.md) records.

!!! note
    When actively developing a Job utilizing a development environment it's important to understand that the "automatically reload when code changes are detected" debugging functionality provided by `nautobot-server runserver` does **not** automatically restart the Celery `worker` process when code changes are made; therefore, it is required to restart the `worker` after each update to your Job source code or else it will continue to run the version of the Job code that was present when it first started.

    Additionally, as of Nautobot 1.3, the Job database records corresponding to installed Jobs are *not* automatically refreshed when the development server auto-restarts. If you make changes to any of the class and module metadata attributes described in the following sections, the database will be refreshed to reflect these changes only after running `nautobot-server migrate` or `nautobot-server post_upgrade` (recommended) or if you manually edit a Job database record to force it to be refreshed.

### Module Metadata Attributes

#### `name` (Grouping)

You can define a global constant called `name` within a job module (the Python file which contains one or more job classes) to set the default grouping under which jobs in this module will be displayed in the Nautobot UI. If this value is not defined, the module's file name will be used. This "grouping" value may also be defined or overridden when editing Job records in the database.

!!! note
    In some UI elements and API endpoints, the module file name is displayed in addition to or in place of this attribute, so even if defining this attribute, you should still choose an appropriately explanatory file name as well.

### Class Metadata Attributes

Job-specific attributes may be defined under a class named `Meta` within each job class you implement. All of these are optional, but encouraged.

#### `name`

This is the human-friendly name of your job, as will be displayed in the Nautobot UI. If not set, the class name will be used.

!!! note
    In some UI elements and API endpoints, the class name is displayed in addition to or in place of this attribute, so even if defining this attribute, you should still choose an appropriately explanatory class name as well.

#### `description`

An optional human-friendly description of what this job does.
This can accept either plain text, Markdown-formatted text, or [a limited subset of HTML](template-filters.md#render_markdown). It can also be multiple lines:

```python
class ExampleJob(Job):
    class Meta:
        description = """
            This job does a number of interesting things.

             1. It hacks the Gibson
             2. It immanentizes the eschaton
             3. It's a floor wax *and* a dessert topping
        """
```

If you code a multi-line description, the first line only will be used in the description column of the jobs list, while the full description will be rendered in the job detail view, submission, approval, and results pages.

#### `approval_required`

Default: `False`

A boolean that will mark this job as requiring approval from another user to be run. For more details on approvals, [please refer to the section on scheduling and approvals](./job-scheduling-and-approvals.md).

#### `commit_default`

Default: `True`

The checkbox to commit database changes when executing a job is checked by default in the Nautobot UI. You can set `commit_default` to `False` under the `Meta` class if you want this option to instead be unchecked by default.

```python
class MyJob(Job):
    class Meta:
        commit_default = False
```

#### `field_order`

Default: `[]`

A list of strings (field names) representing the order your job [variables](#variables) should be rendered as form fields in the job submission UI. If not defined, the variables will be listed in order of their definition in the code. If variables are defined on a parent class and no field order is defined, the parent class variables will appear before the subclass variables.

#### `has_sensitive_variables`

+++ 1.3.10

Default: `True`

Unless set to False, it prevents the job's input parameters from being saved to the database. This defaults to True so as to protect against inadvertent database exposure of input parameters that may include sensitive data such as passwords or other user credentials. Review whether each job's inputs contain any such variables before setting this to False; if a job *does* contain sensitive inputs, if possible you should consider whether the job could be re-implemented using Nautobot's [`Secrets`](../core-functionality/secrets.md) feature as a way to ensure that the sensitive data is not directly provided as a job variable at all.

Important notes about jobs with sensitive variables:

* Such jobs cannot be scheduled to run in the future or on a recurring schedule (as scheduled jobs must by necessity store their variables in the database for future reference).
* Jobs with sensitive variables cannot be marked as requiring approval (as jobs pending approval must store their variables in the database until approved).

#### `hidden`

Default: `False`

A Boolean that if set to `True` prevents the job from being displayed by default in the list of Jobs in the Nautobot UI.

Since the jobs execution framework is designed to be generic, there may be several technical jobs defined by users which interact with or are invoked by external systems. In such cases, these jobs are not meant to be executed by a human and likely do not make sense to expose to end users for execution, and thus having them exposed in the UI at all is extraneous.

Important notes about hidden jobs:

* This is merely hiding them by default from the web interface. It is NOT a security feature.
* In the Jobs list view it is possible to filter to "Hidden: (no selection)" or even "Hidden: Yes" to list the hidden jobs.
* All Job UI and REST API endpoints still exist for hidden jobs and can be accessed by any user who is aware of their existence.
* Hidden jobs can still be executed through the UI or the REST API given the appropriate URL.
* Results for hidden jobs will still appear in the Job Results list after they are run.

#### `read_only`

+++ 1.1.0

Default: `False`

A boolean that designates whether the job is able to make changes to data in the database. The value defaults to `False` but when set to `True`, any data modifications executed from the job's code will be automatically aborted at the end of the job. The job input form is also modified to remove the `commit` checkbox as it is irrelevant for read-only jobs. When a job is marked as read-only, log messages that are normally automatically emitted about the DB transaction state are not included because no changes to data are allowed. Note that user input may still be optionally collected with read-only jobs via job variables, as described below.

#### `soft_time_limit`

+++ 1.3.0

An int or float value, in seconds, which can be used to override the default [soft time limit](../configuration/optional-settings.md#celery_task_soft_time_limit) for a job task to complete.

The `celery.exceptions.SoftTimeLimitExceeded` exception will be raised when this soft time limit is exceeded. The job task can catch this to clean up before the [hard time limit](../configuration/optional-settings.md#celery_task_time_limit) (10 minutes by default) is reached:

```python
from celery.exceptions import SoftTimeLimitExceeded
from nautobot.extras.jobs import Job

class ExampleJobWithSoftTimeLimit(Job):
    class Meta:
        name = "Soft Time Limit"
        description = "Set a soft time limit of 10 seconds`"
        soft_time_limit = 10

    def run(self, data, commit):
        try:
            # code which might take longer than 10 seconds to run
            job_code()
        except SoftTimeLimitExceeded:
            # any clean up code
            cleanup_in_a_hurry()
```

#### `task_queues`

+++ 1.5.0

Default: `[]`

A list of task queue names that the job can be routed to. An empty list will default to only allowing the user to select the [default queue](../configuration/optional-settings.md#celery_task_default_queue) (`default` unless changed by an administrator). The first queue in the list will be used if a queue is not specified in a job run API call.

!!! note
    A worker must be listening on the requested queue or the job will not run. See the documentation on [task queues](../administration/celery-queues.md) for more information.

#### `template_name`

+++ 1.4.0

A path relative to the job source code containing a Django template which provides additional code to customize the Job's submission form. This template should extend the existing job template, `extras/job.html`, otherwise the base form and functionality may not be available.

A template can provide additional JavaScript, CSS, or even display HTML. A good starting template would be:

```html
{% extends 'extras/job.html' %}

{% block extra_styles %}
    {{ block.super }}
    <!-- Add additional CSS here. -->
{% endblock %}
{% block content %}
    {{ block.super }}
    <!-- Add additional HTML here. -->
{% endblock content %}
{% block javascript %}
    {{ block.super }}
    <!-- Add additional JavaScript here. -->
{% endblock javascript %}
```

For another example checkout [the template used in example plugin](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/blob/next/examples/example_plugin/example_plugin/templates/example_plugin/example_with_custom_template.html) in the GitHub repo.

#### `time_limit`

+++ 1.3.0

An int or float value, in seconds, which can be used to override the
default [hard time limit](../configuration/optional-settings.md#celery_task_time_limit) (10 minutes by default) for a job task to complete.

Unlike the `soft_time_limit` above, no exceptions are raised when a `time_limit` is exceeded. The task will just terminate silently:

```python
from nautobot.extras.jobs import Job

class ExampleJobWithHardTimeLimit(Job):
    class Meta:
        name = "Hard Time Limit"
        description = "Set a hard time limit of 10 seconds`"
        time_limit = 10

    def run(self, data, commit):
        # code which might take longer than 10 seconds to run
        # this code will fail silently if the time_limit is exceeded
        job_code()
```

!!! note
    If the `time_limit` is set to a value less than or equal to the `soft_time_limit`, a warning log is generated to inform the user that this job will fail silently after the `time_limit` as the `soft_time_limit` will never be reached.

### Variables

Variables allow your job to accept user input via the Nautobot UI, but they are optional; if your job does not require any user input, there is no need to define any variables. Conversely, if you are making use of user input in your job, you *must* also implement the `run()` method, as it is the only entry point to your job that has visibility into the variable values provided by the user.

```python
from nautobot.extras.jobs import Job, StringVar, IntegerVar, ObjectVar

class CreateDevices(Job):
    var1 = StringVar(...)
    var2 = IntegerVar(...)
    var3 = ObjectVar(...)

    def run(self, data, commit):
        ...
```

The remainder of this section documents the various supported variable types and how to make use of them.

#### Default Variable Options

All job variables support the following default options:

* `default` - The field's default value
* `description` - A brief user-friendly description of the field
* `label` - The field name to be displayed in the rendered form
* `required` - Indicates whether the field is mandatory (all fields are required by default)
* `widget` - The class of form widget to use (see the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/forms/widgets/))

#### `StringVar`

Stores a string of characters (i.e. text). Options include:

* `min_length` - Minimum number of characters
* `max_length` - Maximum number of characters
* `regex` - A regular expression against which the provided value must match

Note that `min_length` and `max_length` can be set to the same number to effect a fixed-length field.

#### `TextVar`

Arbitrary text of any length. Renders as a multi-line text input field.

#### `IntegerVar`

Stores a numeric integer. Options include:

* `min_value` - Minimum value
* `max_value` - Maximum value

#### `BooleanVar`

A true/false flag. This field has no options beyond the defaults listed above.

#### `ChoiceVar`

A set of choices from which the user can select one.

* `choices` - A list of `(value, label)` tuples representing the available choices. For example:

```python
CHOICES = (
    ('n', 'North'),
    ('s', 'South'),
    ('e', 'East'),
    ('w', 'West')
)

direction = ChoiceVar(choices=CHOICES)
```

In the example above, selecting the choice labeled "North" will submit the value `n`.

#### `MultiChoiceVar`

Similar to `ChoiceVar`, but allows for the selection of multiple choices.

#### `ObjectVar`

A particular object within Nautobot. Each ObjectVar must specify a particular model, and allows the user to select one of the available instances. ObjectVar accepts several arguments, listed below.

* `model` - The model class
* `display_field` - The name of the REST API object field to display in the selection list (default: `'display'`)
* `query_params` - A dictionary of REST API query parameters to use when retrieving available options (optional)
* `null_option` - A label representing a "null" or empty choice (optional)

The `display_field` argument is useful in cases where using the `display` API field is not desired for referencing the object. For example, when displaying a list of IP Addresses, you might want to use the `dns_name` field:

```python
device_type = ObjectVar(
    model=IPAddress,
    display_field="dns_name",
)
```

To limit the selections available within the list, additional query parameters can be passed as the `query_params` dictionary. For example, to show only devices with an "active" status:

```python
device = ObjectVar(
    model=Device,
    query_params={
        'status': 'active'
    }
)
```

Multiple values can be specified by assigning a list to the dictionary key. It is also possible to reference the value of other fields in the form by prepending a dollar sign (`$`) to the variable's name. The keys you can use in this dictionary are the same ones that are available in the REST API - as an example it is also possible to filter the `Site` `ObjectVar` for its `tenant_group_id`.

```python
region = ObjectVar(
    model=Region
)
tenant_group = ObjectVar(
    model=TenantGroup
)
site = ObjectVar(
    model=Site,
    query_params={
        'region_id': '$region',
        'tenant_group_id': '$tenant_group'
    }
)
```

#### `MultiObjectVar`

Similar to `ObjectVar`, but allows for the selection of multiple objects.

#### `FileVar`

An uploaded file. Note that uploaded files are present in memory only for the duration of the job's execution: They will not be automatically saved for future use. The job is responsible for writing file contents to disk where necessary.

#### `IPAddressVar`

An IPv4 or IPv6 address, without a mask. Returns a `netaddr.IPAddress` object.

#### `IPAddressWithMaskVar`

An IPv4 or IPv6 address with a mask. Returns a `netaddr.IPNetwork` object which includes the mask.

#### `IPNetworkVar`

An IPv4 or IPv6 network with a mask. Returns a `netaddr.IPNetwork` object. Two attributes are available to validate the provided mask:

* `min_prefix_length` - Minimum length of the mask
* `max_prefix_length` - Maximum length of the mask

### The `run()` Method

The `run()` method, if you choose to implement it, should accept two arguments:

1. `data` - A dictionary which will contain all of the variable data passed in by the user (via the web UI or REST API)
2. `commit` - A boolean indicating whether database changes should be committed. If this is `False`, even if your Job attempts to make database changes, they will be automatically rolled back when the Job completes.

```python
from nautobot.extras.jobs import Job, StringVar, IntegerVar, ObjectVar

class CreateDevices(Job):
    var1 = StringVar(...)
    var2 = IntegerVar(...)
    var3 = ObjectVar(...)

    def run(self, data, commit):
        ...
```

Again, defining user variables is totally optional; you may create a job with just a `run()` method if no user input is needed, in which case `data` will be an empty dictionary.

!!! note
    The `test_*()` and `post_run()` methods do not accept any arguments; if you need to access user `data` or the `commit` flag, your `run()` method is responsible for storing these values in the job instance, such as:

    ```
    def run(self, data, commit):
        self.data = data
        self.commit = commit
    ```

!!! warning
    When writing Jobs that create and manipulate data it is recommended to make use of the `validated_save()` convenience method which exists on all core models. This method saves the instance data but first enforces model validation logic. Simply calling `save()` on the model instance **does not** enforce validation automatically and may lead to bad data. See the development [best practices](../development/best-practices.md).

!!! warning
    The Django ORM provides methods to create/edit many objects at once, namely `bulk_create()` and `update()`. These are best avoided in most cases as they bypass a model's built-in validation and can easily lead to database corruption if not used carefully.

### The `test_*()` Methods

If your job class defines any number of methods whose names begin with `test_`, these will be automatically invoked after the `run()` method (if any) completes. These methods must take no arguments (other than `self`).

Log messages generated by any of these methods will be automatically grouped together by the test method they were invoked from, which can be helpful for readability.

### The `post_run()` Method

If your job class implements a `post_run()` method (which must take no arguments other than `self`), this method will be automatically invoked after the `run()` and `test_*()` methods (if any). It will be called even if one of the other methods raises an exception, so this method can be used to handle any necessary cleanup or final events (such as sending an email or triggering a webhook). The status of the overall job is available at this time as `self.failed` and the associated [`JobResult`](../models/extras/jobresult.md) `data` field is available as `self.results`.

### Logging

The following instance methods are available to log results from an executing job to be stored into [`JobLogEntry`](../models/extras/joblogentry.md) records associated with the current [`JobResult`](../models/extras/jobresult.md):

* `self.log(message)`
* `self.log_debug(message)`
* `self.log_success(obj=None, message=None)`
* `self.log_info(obj=None, message=None)`
* `self.log_warning(obj=None, message=None)`
* `self.log_failure(obj=None, message=None)`

Messages recorded with `log()` or `log_debug()` will appear in a job's results but are never associated with a particular object; the other `log_*` functions may be invoked with or without a provided object to associate the message with.

It is advised to log a message for each object that is evaluated so that the results will reflect how many objects are being manipulated or reported on.

Markdown rendering is supported for log messages, as well as [a limited subset of HTML](template-filters.md#render_markdown).

+/- 1.3.4
    As a security measure, the `message` passed to any of these methods will be passed through the `nautobot.utilities.logging.sanitize()` function in an attempt to strip out information such as usernames/passwords that should not be saved to the logs. This is of course best-effort only, and Job authors should take pains to ensure that such information is not passed to the logging APIs in the first place. The set of redaction rules used by the `sanitize()` function can be configured as [settings.SANITIZER_PATTERNS](../configuration/optional-settings.md#sanitizer_patterns).

!!! note
    Using `self.log_failure()`, in addition to recording a log message, will flag the overall job as failed, but it will **not** stop the execution of the job, nor will it result in an automatic rollback of any database changes made by the job. To end a job early, you can use a Python `raise` or `return` as appropriate. Raising any exception (e.g. `ValueError` for malformed input values) will ensure that any database changes are rolled back as part of the process of ending the job. `AbortTransaction` from Nautobot, which was recommended in past versions of the docs, should explicitly *not* be used, as it is only intended for use by Nautobot's internal job handling.

### Accessing Request Data

Details of the current HTTP request (the one being made to execute the job) are available as the instance attribute `self.request`. This can be used to infer, for example, the user executing the job and their client IP address:

```python
username = self.request.user.username
ip_address = self.request.META.get('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR') or \
    self.request.META.get('REMOTE_ADDR')
self.log_info(f"Running as user {username} (IP: {ip_address})...")
```

For a complete list of available request parameters, please see the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/request-response/).

### Reading Data from Files

The `Job` class provides two convenience methods for reading data from files:

* `load_yaml`
* `load_json`

These two methods will load data in YAML or JSON format, respectively, from files within the local path (i.e. `JOBS_ROOT/`).

## Managing Jobs

As of Nautobot 1.3, each Job class installed in Nautobot is represented by a corresponding Job data record in the Nautobot database. These data records are refreshed when the `nautobot-server migrate` or `nautobot-server post_upgrade` command is run, or (for Jobs from a Git repository) when a Git repository is enabled or re-synced in Nautobot. These data records make it possible for an administrative user (or other user with appropriate access privileges) to exert a level of administrative control over the Jobs created and updated by Job authors.

### Enabling Jobs for Running

When a new Job record is created for a newly discovered Job class, it defaults to `enabled = False`, which prevents the Job from being run by any user. This is intended to provide a level of security and oversight regarding the installation of new Jobs into Nautobot.

!!! important
    One exception to this default is when upgrading from a Nautobot release before 1.3 to Nautobot 1.3.0 or later. In this case, at the time of the upgrade, any Job class that shows evidence of having been run or scheduled under the older Nautobot version (that is, there is at least one JobResult and/or ScheduledJob record that references this Job class) will result in the creation of a Job database record with `enabled = True`. The reasoning for this feature is the assertion that because the Job has been run or scheduled previously, it has presumably already undergone appropriate review at that time, and so it should remain possible to run it as it was possible before the upgrade.

An administrator or user with `extras.change_job` permission can edit the Job to change it to `enabled = True`, permitting running of the Job, when they have completed any appropriate review of the new Job to ensure that it meets their standards. Similarly, an obsolete or no-longer-used Job can be prevented from inadvertent execution by changing it back to `enabled = False`.

 By default when a Job is installed into Nautobot it is installed in a disabled state. In order to enable a Job:

* Navigate to Jobs > Jobs menu
* Select a job that has been installed
* Select **Edit** button
* In the second section titled *Job*, select the **Enabled** checkbox
* Select **Update** button at the bottom

#### Enabling Job Hooks

 Job hooks are enabled in a similar fashion, but by using the *default* filters when navigating to the Jobs page the Job Hooks will not be visible. To enable job hooks:

* Navigate to Jobs > Jobs menu
* Select the **Filter** button to bring up the Filter Jobs context
* Look for **Is job hook receiver** and change the drop down to **Yes**
* Select **Apply** button
* Select a job that has been installed
* Select **Edit** button
* In the second section titled *Job*, select the **Enabled** checkbox
* Select **Update** button at the bottom

### Overriding Metadata

An administrator or user with `extras.change_job` permission can also edit a Job database record to optionally override any or all of the following metadata attributes defined by the Job module or class:

* `grouping`
* `name`
* `description`
* `approval_required`
* `commit_default`
* `has_sensitive_variables`
* `hidden`
* `read_only`
* `soft_time_limit`
* `time_limit`
* `task_queues`

This is done by setting the corresponding "override" flag (`grouping_override`, `name_override`, etc.) to `True` then providing a new value for the attribute in question. An overridden attribute will remain set to its overridden value even if the underlying Job class definition changes and `nautobot-server <migrate|post_upgrade>` gets run again. Conversely, clearing the "override" flag for an attribute and saving the database record will revert the attribute to the underlying value defined within the Job class source code.

### Deleting Jobs

When a previously installed Job class is removed, after running `nautobot-server <migrate|post_upgrade>` or refreshing the providing Git repository, the Job database record will *not* be automatically deleted, but *will* be flagged as `installed = False` and can no longer be run or scheduled.

An administrator or user with `extras.delete_job` permissions *may* delete such a Job database record if desired, but be aware that doing so will result in any existing JobResult or ScheduledJob records that originated from this Job losing their association to the Job; this association will not be automatically restored even if the Job is later reinstalled or reintroduced.

## Running Jobs

!!! note
    To run any job, a user must be assigned the `extras.run_job` permission. This is achieved by assigning the user (or group) a permission on the `extras > job` object and specifying the `run` action in the admin UI as shown below.

    Similarly, to [approve a job request by another user](./job-scheduling-and-approvals.md), a user must be assigned the `extras.approve_job` permission via the same process. Job approvers also need the `extras.change_scheduledjob` and/or `extras.delete_scheduledjob` permissions as job approvals are implemented via the `ScheduledJob` data model.

    ![Adding the run action to a permission](../media/admin_ui_run_permission.png)

### Jobs and `class_path`

It is a key concept to understand the 3 `class_path` elements:

* `grouping_name`: which can be one of `local`, `git`, or `plugins` - depending on where the `Job` has been defined.
* `module_name`: which is the Python path to the job definition file, for a plugin-provided job, this might be something like `my_plugin_name.jobs.my_job_filename` or `nautobot_golden_config.jobs` and is the importable Python path name (which would not include the `.py` extension, as per Python syntax standards).
* `JobClassName`: which is the name of the class inheriting from `nautobot.extras.jobs.Job` contained in the above file.

The `class_path` is often represented as a string in the format of `<grouping_name>/<module_name>/<JobClassName>`, such as
`local/example/MyJobWithNoVars` or `plugins/nautobot_golden_config.jobs/BackupJob`. Understanding the definitions of these
elements will be important in running jobs programmatically.

+/- 1.3.0
    With the addition of Job database models, it is now generally possible and preferable to refer to a job by its UUID primary key, similar to other Nautobot database models, rather than its `class_path`.

### Via the Web UI

Jobs can be run via the web UI by navigating to the job, completing any required form data (if any), and clicking the "Run Job" button.

Once a job has been run, the latest [`JobResult`](../models/extras/jobresult.md) for that job will be summarized in the job list view.

### Via the API

To run a job via the REST API, issue a POST request to the job's endpoint `/api/extras/jobs/<uuid>/run/`. You can optionally provide JSON data to set the `commit` flag, specify any required user input `data`, optional `task_queue`, and/or provide optional scheduling information as described in [the section on scheduling and approvals](./job-scheduling-and-approvals.md).

For example, to run a job with no user inputs and without committing any anything to the database:

```no-highlight
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Token $TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json; version=1.3; indent=4" \
http://nautobot/api/extras/jobs/$JOB_ID/run/
```

Or to run a job that expects user inputs, and commit changes to the database:

```no-highlight
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Token $TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json; version=1.3; indent=4" \
http://nautobot/api/extras/jobs/$JOB_ID/run/ \
--data '{"data": {"string_variable": "somevalue", "integer_variable": 123}, "commit": true}'
```

When providing input data, it is possible to specify complex values contained in `ObjectVar`s, `MultiObjectVar`s, and `IPAddressVar`s.

* `ObjectVar`s can be specified by either using their primary key directly as the value, or as a dictionary containing a more complicated query that gets passed into the Django ORM as keyword arguments.
* `MultiObjectVar`s can be specified as a list of primary keys.
* `IPAddressVar`s can be provided as strings in CIDR notation.

#### Jobs with Files

To run a job that contains `FileVar` inputs via the REST API, you must use `multipart/form-data` content type requests instead of `application/json`. This also requires a slightly different request payload than the example above. The `commit`, `task_queue`, and `schedule` data are flattened and prefixed with underscore to differentiate them from job-specific data. Job specific data is also flattened and not located under the top-level `data` dictionary key.

An example of running a job with both `FileVar` (named `myfile`) and `StringVar` (named `interval`) input:

```no-highlight
curl -X POST \
-H 'Authorization: Token $TOKEN' \
-H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
-H "Accept: application/json; version=1.3; indent=4" \
'http://nautobot/api/extras/jobs/$JOB_ID/run/' \
-F '_commit="true"' \
-F '_schedule_interval="immediately"' \
-F '_schedule_start_time="2022-10-18T17:31:23.698Z"' \
-F 'interval="3"' \
-F 'myfile=@"/path/to/my/file.txt"' \
```

### Via the CLI

Jobs can be run from the CLI by invoking the management command:

```no-highlight
nautobot-server runjob [--username <username>] [--commit] [--local] [--data <data>] <class_path>
```

!!! note
    [See above](#jobs-and-class_path) for `class_path` definitions.

+++ 1.3.10
    The `--data` and `--local` parameters were added.

    The `--data` parameter must be a JSON string, e.g. `--data='{"string_variable": "somevalue", "integer_variable": 123}'`

Using the same example shown in the API:

```no-highlight
nautobot-server runjob --username myusername local/example/MyJobWithNoVars
```

!!! warning
    The `--username <username>` parameter can be used to specify the user that will be identified as the requester of the job. It is optional if the job will not be modifying the database, but is mandatory if you are running with `--commit`, as the specified user will own any resulting database changes.

    Note that `nautobot-server` commands, like all management commands and other direct interactions with the Django database, are not gated by the usual Nautobot user authentication flow. It is possible to specify any existing `--username` with the `nautobot-server runjob` command in order to impersonate any defined user in Nautobot. Use this power wisely and be cautious who you allow to access it.

## Testing Jobs

Jobs are Python code and can be tested as such, usually via [Django unit-test features](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/testing/). That said, there are a few useful tricks specific to testing Jobs.

While individual methods within your Job can and should be tested in isolation, you'll likely also want to test the entire execution of the Job. Nautobot 1.3.3 introduced a few enhancements to make this simpler to do, but it's also quite possible to test in earlier releases with a bit more effort.

### Nautobot 1.3.3 and later

The simplest way to test the entire execution of Jobs from 1.3.3 on is via calling the `nautobot.utilities.testing.run_job_for_testing()` method, which is a helper wrapper around the `run_job` function used to execute a Job via Nautobot's Celery worker process.

Because of the way `run_job_for_testing` and more specifically `run_job()` works, which is somewhat complex behind the scenes, you need to inherit from `nautobot.utilities.testing.TransactionTestCase` instead of `django.test.TestCase` (Refer to the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/testing/tools/#provided-test-case-classes) if you're interested in the differences between these classes - `TransactionTestCase` from Nautobot is a small wrapper around Django's `TransactionTestCase`).

When using `TransactionTestCase` (whether from Django or from Nautobot) each tests runs on a completely empty database. Furthermore, Nautobot requires new jobs to be enabled before they can run. Therefore, we need to make sure the job is enabled before each run which `run_job_for_testing` handles for us.

A simple example of a Job test case for 1.3.3 and forward might look like the following:

```python
from nautobot.extras.models import Job, JobLogEntry
from nautobot.utilities.testing import run_job_for_testing, TransactionTestCase


class MyJobTestCase(TransactionTestCase):
    def test_my_job(self):
        # Testing of Job "MyJob" in file "my_job_file.py" in $JOBS_ROOT
        job = Job.objects.get(job_class_name="MyJob", module_name="my_job_file", source="local")
        # or, job = Job.objects.get_for_class_path("local/my_job_file/MyJob")
        job_result = run_job_for_testing(job, data={}, commit=False)

        # Since we ran with commit=False, any database changes made by the job won't persist,
        # but we can still inspect the logs created by running the job
        log_entries = JobLogEntry.objects.filter(job_result=job_result)
        for log_entry in log_entries:
            self.assertEqual(log_entry.message, "...")
```

!!! tip
    For more advanced examples (such as testing jobs executed with `commit=True`, for example) refer to the Nautobot source code, specifically `nautobot/extras/tests/test_jobs.py`.

### Nautobot 1.3.2 and earlier (including 1.2)

If your test case needs to be backwards-compatible with test execution against Nautobot 1.3.2 and/or earlier, you need to handle a couple more things manually:

Set up the `"job_logs"` database correctly for testing:

```python
from django.conf import settings

if "job_logs" in settings.DATABASES:
    settings.DATABASES["job_logs"] = settings.DATABASES["job_logs"].copy()
    settings.DATABASES["job_logs"]["TEST"] = {"MIRROR": "default"}
```

Replicate the behavior of `run_job_for_testing` manually so that your test execution most closely resembles the way the celery worker would run the test:

```python
import uuid
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType

from nautobot.extras.context_managers import web_request_context
from nautobot.extras.jobs import run_job
from nautobot.extras.models import JobResult, Job

def run_job_for_testing(job, data=None, commit=True, username="test-user"):
    if data is None:
        data = {}
    user_model = get_user_model()
    user, _ = user_model.objects.get_or_create(username=username, is_superuser=True, password="password")
    job_result = JobResult.objects.create(
        name=job.class_path,
        obj_type=ContentType.objects.get_for_model(Job),
        user=user,
        job_id=uuid.uuid4(),
    )
    with web_request_context(user=user) as request:
        run_job(data=data, request=request, commit=commit, job_result_pk=job_result.pk)
    return job_result
```

Setup the `databases` field on the test class correctly, and re-create the default Statuses on `setUp` in your test classes, because `django.test.TransactionTestCase` truncates them on every `tearDown`:

```python
from django.apps import apps
from django.conf import settings
from django.test import TransactionTestCase

from nautobot.extras.management import populate_status_choices

class MyJobTestCase(TransactionTestCase):
    # 'job_logs' is a proxy connection to the same (default) database that's used exclusively for Job logging
    if "job_logs" in settings.DATABASES:
        databases = ("default", "job_logs")

    def setUp(self):
        super().setUp()
        populate_status_choices(apps, None)
```

## Debugging job performance

+++ 1.5.17

Debugging the performance of Nautobot jobs can be tricky, because they are executed in the worker context. In order to gain extra visibility, [cProfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html) can be used to profile the job execution.

The 'profile' form field on jobs is automatically available when the `DEBUG` settings is `True`. When you select that checkbox, a profiling report in the pstats format will be written to the file system of the environment where the job runs. Normally, this is on the file system of the worker process, but if you are using the `nautobot-server runjob` command with `--local`, it will end up in the file system of the web application itself. The path of the written file will be logged in the job.

!!! note
    If you need to run this in an environment where `DEBUG` is `False`, you have the option of using `nautobot-server runjob` with the `--profile` flag. According to the docs, `cProfile` should have minimal impact on the performance of the job; still, proceed with caution when using this in a production environment.

### Reading profiling reports

A full description on how to deal with the output of `cProfile` can be found in the [Instant User's Manual](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#instant-user-s-manual), but here is something to get you started:

```python
import pstats
job_result_uuid = "66b70231-002f-412b-8cc4-1cc9609c2c9b"
stats = pstats.Stats(f"/tmp/job-result-{job_result_uuid}.pstats")
stats.sort_stats(pstats.SortKey.CUMULATIVE).print_stats(10)
```

This will print the 10 functions that the job execution spent the most time in - adapt this to your needs!

## Example Jobs

### Creating objects for a planned site

This job prompts the user for three variables:

* The name of the new site
* The device model (a filtered list of defined device types)
* The number of access switches to create

These variables are presented as a web form to be completed by the user. Once submitted, the job's `run()` method is called to create the appropriate objects, and it returns simple CSV output to the user summarizing the created objects.

```python
from django.utils.text import slugify

from nautobot.dcim.models import Device, DeviceRole, DeviceType, Manufacturer, Site
from nautobot.extras.models import Status
from nautobot.extras.jobs import *


class NewBranch(Job):

    class Meta:
        name = "New Branch"
        description = "Provision a new branch site"
        field_order = ['site_name', 'switch_count', 'switch_model']

    site_name = StringVar(
        description="Name of the new site"
    )
    switch_count = IntegerVar(
        description="Number of access switches to create"
    )
    manufacturer = ObjectVar(
        model=Manufacturer,
        required=False
    )
    switch_model = ObjectVar(
        description="Access switch model",
        model=DeviceType,
        query_params={
            'manufacturer_id': '$manufacturer'
        }
    )

    def run(self, data, commit):
        STATUS_PLANNED = Status.objects.get(slug='planned')

        # Create the new site
        site = Site(
            name=data['site_name'],
            slug=slugify(data['site_name']),
            status=STATUS_PLANNED,
        )
        site.validated_save()
        self.log_success(obj=site, message="Created new site")

        # Create access switches
        switch_role = DeviceRole.objects.get(name='Access Switch')
        for i in range(1, data['switch_count'] + 1):
            switch = Device(
                device_type=data['switch_model'],
                name=f'{site.slug}-switch{i}',
                site=site,
                status=STATUS_PLANNED,
                device_role=switch_role
            )
            switch.validated_save()
            self.log_success(obj=switch, message="Created new switch")

        # Generate a CSV table of new devices
        output = [
            'name,make,model'
        ]
        for switch in Device.objects.filter(site=site):
            attrs = [
                switch.name,
                switch.device_type.manufacturer.name,
                switch.device_type.model
            ]
            output.append(','.join(attrs))

        return '\n'.join(output)
```

### Device validation

A job to perform various validation of Device data in Nautobot. As this job does not require any user input, it does not define any variables, nor does it implement a `run()` method.

```python
from nautobot.dcim.models import ConsolePort, Device, PowerPort
from nautobot.extras.models import Status
from nautobot.extras.jobs import Job


class DeviceConnectionsReport(Job):
    description = "Validate the minimum physical connections for each device"

    def test_console_connection(self):
        STATUS_ACTIVE = Status.objects.get(slug='active')

        # Check that every console port for every active device has a connection defined.
        for console_port in ConsolePort.objects.prefetch_related('device').filter(device__status=STATUS_ACTIVE):
            if console_port.connected_endpoint is None:
                self.log_failure(
                    obj=console_port.device,
                    message="No console connection defined for {}".format(console_port.name)
                )
            elif not console_port.connection_status:
                self.log_warning(
                    obj=console_port.device,
                    message="Console connection for {} marked as planned".format(console_port.name)
                )
            else:
                self.log_success(obj=console_port.device)

    def test_power_connections(self):
        STATUS_ACTIVE = Status.objects.get(slug='active')

        # Check that every active device has at least two connected power supplies.
        for device in Device.objects.filter(status=STATUS_ACTIVE):
            connected_ports = 0
            for power_port in PowerPort.objects.filter(device=device):
                if power_port.connected_endpoint is not None:
                    connected_ports += 1
                    if not power_port.connection_status:
                        self.log_warning(
                            obj=device,
                            message="Power connection for {} marked as planned".format(power_port.name)
                        )
            if connected_ports < 2:
                self.log_failure(
                    obj=device,
                    message="{} connected power supplies found (2 needed)".format(connected_ports)
                )
            else:
                self.log_success(obj=device)
```

# Additional Template Filters

## Introduction

Nautobot uses 2 template engines internally, Django Template and Jinja2. Django Template is used to render the UI pages and Jinja2 is used for features such as computed fields, custom links, export templates, etc.

!!! note
    Jinja2 and Django Template are very similar, the main difference between them is the syntax of the template. Historically, Django Template has been the go-to solution to generate webpage in Django and Jinja2 is the industry standard outside of Django.

Both Django Template and Jinja2 can be extended with a library of functions, called `filters`, that apply formatting or transformations to a provided input. Nautobot provides many built-in `filters`, including network specific `filters` from the [netutils library](https://netutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Netutils Filters

+++ 1.2.0

[Netutils](https://netutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is an external library, maintained by Network to Code, that is focusing on providing a collection of functions for common network automation tasks. Please [check the netutils documentation](https://netutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to see the list of available functions.

These functions are available automatically in Jinja2 rendered by Nautobot. For example you could define a [computed field](../models/extras/computedfield.md) on Circuit objects, using the Netutils `bits_to_name` function, to display the "Commit Rate" as a human-readable value by using the template code `{{ (obj.commit_rate * 1000) | bits_to_name }}`. (This particular example is contrived, as the Nautobot UI already humanizes the raw `commit_rate` value for display, but it demonstrates the kinds of things that these filters can be used for.)

In general the syntax for using a netutils filter in a Jinja2 template is something like `{{ arg1 | function_name }}` for functions that take a single argument, and `{{ arg1 | function_name(arg_name2=arg2, arg_name3=arg3) }}` for functions that take multiple arguments.

+++ 1.5.11
    Netutils functions are also available in Django templates after using the `{% load netutils %}` directive in a template. The syntax to use these functions is then generally `{% function_name arg_name1=arg1 arg_name2=arg2 %}`.

## Nautobot Built-In Filters

The Nautobot project also provides the following built-in `filters` that can be used in both Jinja2 and Django Template.

### as_range

Given a list of *n* items, return a corresponding range of *n* integers.

```django
# Django template
{% for i in record.parents|as_range %}
    <i class="mdi mdi-circle-small"></i>
{% endfor %}
```

### bettertitle

Alternative to the built-in `title` filter; capitalizes words without replacing letters that are already uppercase.

For example, `title("IP address") == "Ip Address"`, while `bettertitle("IP address") == "IP Address"`.

```django
{{ obj_type.name|bettertitle }}
```

### divide

Return x/y (rounded).

```django
# Django Template
{{ powerfeed.available_power|divide:3 }}VA

# Jinja
{{ powerfeed.available_power|divide(3) }}
```

### fgcolor

Return the ideal foreground color (black `"#000000"` or white `"#ffffff"`) given an arbitrary background color in RRGGBB format.

```django
color: {{ object.status.color|fgcolor }}
```

### get_docs_url

Return the static URL of the documentation for the specified model.

```django
{{ obj | get_docs_url }}
```

### get_item

Access a specific item/key in a dictionary.

```django
# Django Template
{{ labels|get_item:key }}

# Jinja
{{ labels|get_item(key) }}
```

### has_one_or_more_perms

Return True if the user has *at least one* of the permissions in the list.

```django
# Django Template
{{ request.user|has_one_or_more_perms:panel_details.permissions }}

# Jinja
{{ request.user|has_one_or_more_perms(panel_details.permissions) }}
```

### has_perms

Return True if the user has *all* permissions in the list.

```django
# Django Template
{{ request.user|has_perms:group_item_details.permissions }}

# Jinja
{{ request.user|has_perms(group_item_details.permissions) }}
```

### humanize_speed

Humanize speeds given in Kbps.
    1544 => "1.544 Mbps"
    100000 => "100 Mbps"
    10000000 => "10 Gbps"

```django
{{ speed_value | humanize_speed }}
```

### hyperlinked_object

+++ 1.4.0

Render and link to a Django model instance, if any, or render a placeholder if not.

Uses `object.display` if available, otherwise uses the string representation of the object.
If the object defines `get_absolute_url()` this will be used to hyperlink the displayed object;
additionally if there is an `object.description` this will be used as the title of the hyperlink.

```django
{{ device|hyperlinked_object }}
```

+++ 1.5.0
    This filter now accepts an optional `field` parameter, which allows you to use a field other than `object.display` for the object representation if desired. For example, to display the object's `name` field instead:

    ```django
    # Django Template
    {{ location|hyperlinked_object:"name" }}

    # Jinja
    {{ location|hyperlinked_object("name") }}
    ```

### meta

Return the specified Meta attribute of a model.

```django
{{ obj | meta('app_label') }}
```

### meters_to_feet

Convert a length from meters to feet.

```django
{{ meter_value | meters_to_feet }}
```

### percentage

Return x/y as a percentage.

```django
# Django Template
{{ powerfeed.available_power|percentage:total_power }}VA

# Jinja
{{ powerfeed.available_power|percentage(total_power) }}
```

### placeholder

Render a muted placeholder (`<span class="text-muted">&mdash;</span>`) if value is falsey, else render the provided value.

```django
{{ html | placeholder }}
```

### render_boolean

Render HTML from a computed boolean value.

If value is (for example) a non-empty string or True or a non-zero number, this renders `<span class="text-success"><i class="mdi mdi-check-bold" title="Yes"></i></span>`

If value is (for example) "" or 0 or False, this renders `<span class="text-danger"><i class="mdi mdi-close-thick" title="No"></i></span>`

If value is None this renders `<span class="text-muted">&mdash;</span>`

```django
{{ value | render_boolean }}
```

### render_json

Render a dictionary as formatted JSON.

```django
{{ data | render_json }}
```

### render_markdown

Render and sanitize Markdown text into HTML. A limited subset of HTML tags and attributes are permitted in the text as well; non-permitted HTML will be stripped from the output for security.

```django
{{ text | render_markdown }}
```

#### Permitted HTML Tags and Attributes

+++ 1.6.10

The set of permitted HTML tags is defined in `nautobot.core.constants.HTML_ALLOWED_TAGS`, and their permitted attributes are defined in `nautobot.core.constants.HTML_ALLOWED_ATTRIBUTES`. As of Nautobot 1.6.10 the following are permitted:

----- FILE: changes_5134.security (NEW) -----
Fixed an XSS vulnerability ([GHSA-v4xv-795h-rv4h](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-v4xv-795h-rv4h)) in the `render_markdown()` utility function used to render comments, notes, job log entries, etc.

# Note

+++ 1.4.0

Notes provide a place for you to store notes or general information on an object, such as a Device, that may not require a specific field for. This could be a note on a recent upgrade, a warning about a problematic device, or the reason the Rack was marked with the Status `Retired`.

The note field supports [Markdown Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/#basic-syntax) as well as [a limited subset of HTML](../../additional-features/template-filters.md#render_markdown).
